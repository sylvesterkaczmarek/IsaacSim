# Actor SDG Sweep Config

## Purpose

Generate reproducible variations of an Isaac Sim Replicator Agent (IRA) YAML configuration. A sweep samples selected
configuration fields across multiple variants. Each variant receives a distinct random seed and writer output
directory. Optionally run `actor_sdg.py` on each generated variant via `scripts/batch_actor_sdg.py`.

## Security

Schema validation runs by default. `--omit-schema-check` writes variants without JSON Schema verification; use only
when the caller explicitly accepts unchecked YAML (for example schema unavailable offline). Prefer `--dry-run` to
preview without writing files. Batch execution launches the local `actor_sdg.py` entry point via subprocess with a
fixed argument list (`shell=False`).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 with PyYAML.
- `jsonschema` and the IRA `config_schema` directory for schema validation.
- An existing IRA YAML configuration with the `isaacsim.replicator.agent` root key.
- A writable output directory, preferably under `$WORKSPACE_DIR`.
- An Isaac Sim install or source build for optional Actor SDG execution.

## Limitations

- The generator changes fields that already exist in the base configuration. It may add the standard root `seed`
  field when the base omits it.
- Schema validation cannot run without `jsonschema` and the matching schema from the installed IRA extension.
- Config generation is deterministic. Actor SDG execution is not idempotent and can replace dataset outputs.
- The batch runner executes variants sequentially. It does not schedule work across machines or GPUs.

## Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/config_variation_generator.py` | Generate validated config variants and `manifest.csv`. | CLI flags through `argparse`; run with `--help` for details. |
| `scripts/batch_actor_sdg.py` | Preview or run `actor_sdg.py` for generated variants. | CLI flags through `argparse`; run with `--help` for details. |

## Running scripts

From agent runtimes that expose skill execution helpers, invoke a script with `run_script()`:

```text
run_script(
    "scripts/config_variation_generator.py",
    args=[
        "--base", "base.yaml",
        "--sweep", "sweep.yaml",
        "--output", "variants",
        "--dry-run",
    ],
)
```

From the repository root, run the generator with Python:

```bash
python3 skills/actor-sdg-sweep-config/scripts/config_variation_generator.py \
  --base base.yaml \
  --sweep sweep.yaml \
  --output "$WORKSPACE_DIR/actor_sdg_variants" \
  --dry-run
```

## Sweep specification

The sweep file contains a positive `count` and a `parameters` list:

```yaml
count: 12
parameters:
  - path: isaacsim.replicator.agent.character.groups.workers.num
    type: choice
    values: [5, 10, 20]
  - path: isaacsim.replicator.agent.simulation_duration
    type: fixed
    value: 30
```

Supported sampling types are:

| Type | Required value |
|---|---|
| `choice` | A non-empty `values` list. |
| `uniform` | An ordered numeric `range`. |
| `random_int` | An ordered integer `range`. |
| `linspace` | An ordered numeric `range`. |
| `fixed` | A `value`. |

## Workflow

### 1. Validate the inputs

1. Resolve the base configuration and sweep file.
2. Parse both files as YAML mappings.
3. Require the `isaacsim.replicator.agent` root key.
4. Confirm that every dotted sweep path exists in the base configuration, except the standard root `seed`.
5. Confirm the count and sampling values are valid.

### 2. Preview the sweep

Run the generator with `--dry-run`:

```bash
python3 skills/actor-sdg-sweep-config/scripts/config_variation_generator.py \
  --base base.yaml \
  --sweep sweep.yaml \
  --output "$WORKSPACE_DIR/actor_sdg_variants" \
  --seed 42 \
  --dry-run
```

Report the count, parameter paths, sampling types, seed, schema location, and output directory. The generator refuses
to replace existing variant directories by default. Pass `--overwrite` only after the user approves replacement.

### 3. Generate the configurations

Remove `--dry-run` after the preview is correct:

```bash
python3 skills/actor-sdg-sweep-config/scripts/config_variation_generator.py \
  --base base.yaml \
  --sweep sweep.yaml \
  --output "$WORKSPACE_DIR/actor_sdg_variants" \
  --seed 42
```

Use `--schema-dir` when automatic schema discovery cannot find the installed IRA schema. Do not use
`--omit-schema-check` unless the user accepts unvalidated output.

### 4. Verify the configurations

1. Confirm the command exits with code `0`.
2. Confirm the number of `variant_*/config.yaml` files matches the requested count.
3. Read `manifest.csv` and one generated configuration.
4. Report whether schema validation passed, was skipped, or was unavailable.
5. Do not call the configurations valid when schema validation did not run.

### 5. Preview optional data generation

Use the batch runner in dry-run mode:

```bash
python3 skills/actor-sdg-sweep-config/scripts/batch_actor_sdg.py \
  --variants "$WORKSPACE_DIR/actor_sdg_variants" \
  --python-sh "$ISAAC_SIM_DIR/python.sh" \
  --actor-sdg "$ISAAC_SIM_DIR/tools/actor_sdg/actor_sdg.py" \
  --dry-run
```

Before removing `--dry-run`, report the selected configurations, output locations, and expected runtime. Actor SDG
execution can replace generated data, so run it only after the user approves the batch.

### 6. Report the result

Report the base configuration, sweep file, output directory, count, seed, manifest path, validation status, and any
failed variant IDs. After data generation, read `run_results.csv` and report each failed variant.

## Troubleshooting

| Error or symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Sweep path does not exist | The dotted path is absent from the base configuration. | Correct the path or add the field to the base configuration first. |
| Schema validation unavailable | `jsonschema` or the matching IRA schema is missing. | Install `jsonschema` and pass `--schema-dir`. |
| Output variants already exist | The generator protects existing files. | Inspect the variants, then rerun with `--overwrite` after approval. |
| `actor_sdg.py` not found | The install or source path was not detected. | Pass the exact path through `--actor-sdg`. |
| A batch variant fails | Actor SDG returned a nonzero exit code or timed out. | Inspect its log and the matching row in `run_results.csv`. |
