# Isaac Sim Orchestrator

## Purpose

Turn an established goal or demo contract into a runnable simulation by mapping capabilities, executing specialist skills in order, and validating output before delivery. Use `isaac-sim-workflow` first when the deliverable and acceptance criteria still need to be scoped.

## Prerequisites

- Built Isaac Sim (`$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` or `_build/linux-x86_64/release`).
- NVIDIA GPU with a current driver (`nvidia-smi`).
- Shell env contract from `isaac-sim-orchestrator`: `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR`, `$ISAAC_LAB_DIR`, `$WORKSPACE_DIR`.

## Limitations

- Targets Isaac Sim 6 / Kit 110 unless a section states otherwise.
- Does not replace official NVIDIA documentation for unsupported edge cases.

## Troubleshooting

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Extension or import not found | Wrong `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` or stale build | Point env vars at `_build/linux-x86_64/release` or rebuild |
| Black or empty frames | Missing lights or non-RTX render mode | Add dome/key light; confirm RTX / PathTracing settings |
| Hang on stage load or first render | MDL compile or oversized stage | Follow isolation steps in `isaac-sim-troubleshooting` |

## Environment contract

Every routed skill assumes these variables; set them in the agent config or shell:

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` | Isaac Sim install root or built repo path | `$HOME/IsaacSim` (install) or `<this-repo>/_build/linux-x86_64/release` (source build) |
| `$ISAAC_LAB_DIR` | Isaac Lab checkout | `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR/IsaacLab` |
| `$WORKSPACE_DIR` | Per-agent outputs, scratch, caches | unset by default; pick a project-local path or `~/.cache/<repo>` |
| `$CIP_ROOT` (Windows) | Content-pipeline install (CIP/WRAPP) | `C:\_Data` |

Run `nvidia-smi` at session start to size `num_envs` and pick RT2 vs PathTracing. Do not hardcode GPU class.

## Execution mode

Prefer live iteration: when a sim is running, push code over the Python server via
`isaac-sim-remote` (port 8226). Write a standalone script only for handoff/repro;
avoid `python.sh` except to test that script.

Launch a server-enabled sim using the launch procedure in `isaac-sim-remote`; do not duplicate its command here.

## Task decomposition

For any request, run all four phases. The specific steps inside each phase depend on the goal; identify capabilities first, then verify each in isolation before combining.

### Phase 1 — Verify foundations

**1a. Feature/skill mapping** (before any code):
- If the request is a demo, load `isaac-sim-workflow` first: it defines the deliverable type, acceptance criteria, validation needs, and routes back through these phases with that context.
- Cross-check the request against documented Isaac Sim features and APIs.
- For each capability, look up an existing skill:
  - Skill exists -> load it, follow its procedure.
  - Skill missing -> build one inline. Mark its frontmatter `status: draft`, flag it `HIGH PRIORITY` in `skill-distillation`, tell the user upfront, and shorten iteration cycles (share intermediate results, ask targeted questions early).
- Write the feature -> skill mapping into the task `WORKLOG.md` before 1b.

**1b. Foundation verification** (capability by capability):
- List every capability the task needs (assets, physics, robot control, sensors, rendering, ...).
- Verify each in isolation: does it load, does it behave correctly on its own.
- Do not move on until each foundation passes.

### Phase 2 — Incremental integration

Combine verified foundations one at a time. Re-run stability/correctness checks after each addition. Every failure has exactly one new variable.

### Phase 3 — Polish & deliver

- Validate output visually or programmatically. Task success, not just script completion.
- Add output-specific requirements (writers, annotations, video capture, DR).
- Package and hand off with a short summary.

### Phase 4 — Distill (mandatory)

- List iterations, failures, workarounds.
- Record user corrections.
- Classify each lesson: new skill, skill update, procedure fix, or `MEMORY.md` fact.
- Update the skill files; re-read to confirm a fresh agent can follow them.

See `skill-distillation` for the full procedure. Phase 4 is not optional.

## Sub-agent rules

- Each phase can run as a sub-agent with its own `WORKLOG.md`.
- Sub-agents commit at logical checkpoints, never half-done.
- Large script generation: write incrementally to files. Do not try to produce 200+ lines in one turn.
- If a sub-agent times out, `WORKLOG.md` survives for the next pickup.

## Routed skills

| Skill | Use for |
|---|---|
| `isaac-sim-remote` | Live Python-server iteration against a running sim (preferred over standalone during dev) |
| `urdf-mjcf-to-usd-conversion` | Import URDF/MJCF robot descriptions to USD with physics APIs and articulation structure |
| `usd-pipeline` | Asset insertion, scaling, materials, headless render compatibility |
| `usd-composition-architecture` | Layered USD assets (root + physics + appearance) |
| `usd-articulation` | Multi-link articulations, joint hierarchies, Robot Schema overlay |
| `physics-simulation` | PhysicsScene config, per-prim setup, contact materials, Newton vs PhysX |
| `isaac-sim-sensor` | RTX/physics sensors (camera, LiDAR, IMU, contact), render products, annotators |
| `isaac-sim-rendering` | Headless Kit 110 capture, RT2/PathTracing, ACES |
| `isaac-sim-validator` | Final QA gate before delivery |

For the modern Kit 110 public API surface (bootstrap, stage/app utilities, common calls) used across these skills, see [`references/api-cheatsheet.md`](references/api-cheatsheet.md).

## Multi-robot fleet reference

### Sample robots

| Robot | Start Z | Drive | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nova Carter | 0.0 | differential | wheel radius 0.14 m, track 0.499 m; damping 100K |
| VSVXL | 0.0 | differential | most reliable; wheel radius 0.15 m, track 1.52 m |
| Spot | 0.75 | omni-wheel | bbox min Z = -0.69; needs ground clearance |
| FR3 | 0.0 | fixed-base | end-effector only, not mobile |

### Scene setup

- `sim_warehouse_v4.usda` pattern: `shell` + `lights` + `racks` + `PhysicsScene` + ground collision.
- Shell (`sm_warehouse_mega.usd`) is in cm; robots and equipment in meters.
- Strip physics from environment assets offline. Runtime stripping core-dumps on large stages.

### PhysicsScene

```python
from pxr import UsdPhysics, PhysxSchema

physics_scene = UsdPhysics.Scene.Define(stage, "/World/PhysicsScene")
physics_scene.CreateGravityDirectionAttr().Set((0, 0, -1))
physics_scene.CreateGravityMagnitudeAttr().Set(9.81)

physx_scene = PhysxSchema.PhysxSceneAPI.Apply(physics_scene.GetPrim())
physx_scene.CreateEnableCCDAttr().Set(True)
physx_scene.CreateEnableStabilizationAttr().Set(True)
physx_scene.CreateSolverTypeAttr().Set("TGS")
physx_scene.CreateTimeStepsPerSecondAttr().Set(60)
physx_scene.CreateGpuMaxNumPartitionsAttr().Set(8)   # 10+ robots
```

### Grid placement

```python
import math

def place_robots_grid(stage, robot_usd_path, prefix, count, spacing=3.0, start_z=0.0):
    cols = math.ceil(math.sqrt(count))
    robots = []
    for i in range(count):
        row, col = divmod(i, cols)
        x, y = col * spacing, row * spacing
        prim_path = f"/World/Robots/{prefix}_{i}"
        ref = stage.OverridePrim(prim_path)
        ref.GetReferences().AddReference(robot_usd_path)
        from pxr import UsdGeom, Gf
        xform = UsdGeom.Xformable(ref)
        xform.ClearXformOpOrder()
        xform.AddTranslateOp().Set(Gf.Vec3d(x, y, start_z))
        robots.append(prim_path)
    return robots
```

### Separation

- Mobile robots: minimum 2 m between centers.
- Articulated arms: 1.5x reach radius minimum.
- Aerial: stagger altitudes by >= 2 m.

### Collision groups

```python
from pxr import PhysxSchema

def create_collision_group(stage, group_path, robot_paths):
    group = PhysxSchema.PhysxCollisionAPI.Apply(stage.DefinePrim(group_path))
    for path in robot_paths:
        prim = stage.GetPrimAtPath(path)
        collision_api = PhysxSchema.PhysxCollisionAPI.Apply(prim)
        collision_api.GetCollisionGroupsRel().AddTarget(group_path)
```

### Scaling limits (by VRAM)

Limits scale approximately linearly with available VRAM. Beyond these thresholds risks CUDA OOM.

| Metric | 12 GB | 24 GB | 48 GB | 96 GB | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total prims | ~12K | ~25K | ~50K | ~100K | scales linearly |
| Robots | <= 2 | <= 5 | <= 10 | <= 20 | depends on complexity |
| Active rigid bodies per robot | ~200 | ~200 | ~200 | ~200 | per-robot constant |
| Articulations (multi-DOF) | <= 2 | <= 5 | <= 10 | <= 20 | |
| Render resolution | 1280x720 | 1600x900 | 1920x1080 | 2560x1440 | single viewport |

Optimization:

- `make_instanceable: true` in URDF config.yaml (shared mesh data).
- LOD switching for distant robots.
- Disable physics on robots outside the active zone.

### Navigation

Differential drive kinematics:

```
vL = (vx - omega * tw/2) / wheel_r
vR = (vx + omega * tw/2) / wheel_r
```

PD steering defaults: `KP=2.5`, `KD=1.2`, `MAX_W=1.5`, waypoint tolerance 4.0 m. Out-of-bounds: `|Z| > 50` or `|X|/|Y| > 500` -> mark dead.

### Camera

Chase camera: 12 m behind, min height 2.5 m, clamped inside warehouse bounds, smooth interpolation `alpha = min(1.0, DT*2.0)`. Dynamically raise camera to avoid rack intrusion.

View modes (cycle every 4 s): chase, overhead (z=50 m), aisle (eye-level), wide (z=20 m, yaw=0).

### Lighting (warehouse default)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| filmISO | 100-120 (200 overexposes, 80 too dark in aisles) |
| DomeLight | intensity 150, color (0.85, 0.88, 0.95) |
| Fill SphereLights | intensity 1200, color (1.0, 0.95, 0.85), height 8-9 m |
| RectLights | ceiling-mounted, aisle-aligned |

### Rendering

- `RayTracedLighting` (RT2), 1920x1080.
- 320x240 window with `hideUi=1` to save GPU.
- Always set `DISPLAY=:0`; headless viewport init fails for complex regions.
- `maxBounces=7`, `aovs=none`.

### Timing

```
DT = 1/60
Settle: 200-500 frames after timeline.play()
Capture: every 4th step (15 fps)
```

## Workflow: multi-robot sim

1. Receive request (e.g. "6 Novas in a warehouse with 100 racks").
2. Compose scene: load warehouse USD, position robots via `place_robots_grid`.
3. Create collision groups if needed.
4. Use `usd-pipeline` to validate mesh scale and shaders.
5. Run in a persistent session: iterate live via `isaac-sim-remote` (Python server), or `isaac-sim.sh --exec script.py` for a standalone/handoff run.
6. Use a render-pulse loop every 100 steps.
7. Validate the render via `isaac-sim-validator`.
8. Deliver video and final scene.

## Workflow: Physical AI end-to-end pipeline

Route chain for tasks that span asset import, physics, sensors, and validation (e.g. "import a Franka arm, simulate grasping, capture LiDAR + RGB, validate").

```

### Stage 1 — Asset import

| Input | Skill | Output contract |
|---|---|---|
| URDF/MJCF file | `urdf-mjcf-to-usd-conversion` | USD with `IsaacRobotAPI`, `IsaacLinkAPI`, `IsaacJointAPI`, collision meshes |
| USD environment assets | `usd-pipeline` | Measured, shader-classified, placed assets with bbox offsets |
| Multi-layer composition | `usd-composition-architecture` | Root + physics + appearance layers |

Handoff to Stage 2: USD file(s) on disk, prim paths known, `make_instanceable: true` for RL workloads.

### Stage 2 — Physics setup

| Input | Skill | Output contract |
|---|---|---|
| Imported USD stage | `physics-simulation` | `PhysicsScene` (gravity, solver, timestep, CCD), per-prim `RigidBodyAPI`/`CollisionAPI`/`MassAPI`, contact materials, joint drives |
| Multi-DOF robot | `usd-articulation` | Articulation root, joint hierarchy, drive stiffness/damping |

Prerequisites from Stage 1:
- Robot USD must have `IsaacRobotAPI` on root (applied by importer).
- Static environment prims need `CollisionAPI` only (no `RigidBodyAPI`).
- PhysicsScene is always created here even if the importer applied per-joint attrs.

Handoff to Stage 3: Sim plays without crashes, robot holds pose under gravity for 200 frames.

### Stage 3 — Sensor attachment

| Input | Skill | Output contract |
|---|---|---|
| Stable sim stage | `isaac-sim-sensor` | Sensor prims parented to robot links, render products with annotators |
| Camera intrinsics | `isaac-camera` | Configured USD cameras with lens model and focal params |
| Runtime verification | `isaac-sim-remote` | Push sensor config live, verify data stream non-zero |

Mount-point convention: sensors attach to Xform prims under robot links. If the imported URDF lacks a mount link, create one:
```python
mount = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, f"{robot_path}/{link_name}/sensor_mount")
```

Handoff to Stage 4: At least one frame of non-zero sensor data (depth > 0, point cloud non-empty, IMU reports gravity).

### Stage 4 — Validate and deliver

| Input | Skill | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Complete sim script | `isaac-sim-validator` | No deprecated imports, no hardcoded paths, lights present, render not black |
| Rendered frames | `isaac-sim-rendering` | Frame quality, ACES tonemap, resolution |
| Runtime behavior | (manual or scripted) | Physics: robot stays grounded, no NaN. Sensors: data stream matches expected range |

The validator gates delivery but does not cover runtime physics/sensor correctness. For runtime checks, verify:
1. `RigidBodyAPI.GetVelocityAttr()` stays finite across the sim window.
2. Sensor annotator data shape matches configured resolution/channels.
3. Articulation joint positions stay within drive limits.

### End-to-end procedure

1. **Phase 1a** — Map request features to the pipeline stages above.
2. **Phase 1b** — Verify each stage in isolation:
   - Import: USD loads without errors, prim count reasonable for VRAM.
   - Physics: Robot holds pose, `timeline.play()` + 200 frames stable.
   - Sensors: One sensor produces valid data on a simplified scene.
3. **Phase 2** — Integrate incrementally (import → physics → sensors), re-checking stability after each addition.
4. **Phase 3** — Run `isaac-sim-validator`, capture final output, deliver.
5. **Phase 4** — Distill lessons per `skill-distillation`.

## Debug protocol

### Rendering

| Issue | Action |
|---|---|
| Black frame | DomeLight + DistantLight present; force `settings.set("/rtx/rendermode", "RayTracedLighting")`; check `nvidia-smi` |
| Garbled color | ACES tonemap (`/rtx/post/tonemap/op=4`); `filmISO=600` for warehouse; remove `PathTracing` |
| Stuttering | `DT=1/60`; `setTimeStepsPerSecond=60`; update display rate, not physics rate |
| Fractures | Mesh integrity; reduce bump/normal map resolution; low-res collision meshes |
| Articulations move wrong | `SolverType=TGS` (fabric); `maxPositionIterations >= 6`; `make_instanceable: true` |
| OOM crash | `pkill -f "kit/kit"`; clean `/dev/shm/carb-*`; reduce num_envs |

### Asset loading

| Issue | Action |
|---|---|
| Asset renders black | `UsdPreviewSurface` or dual-shader; relative paths (`./meshes/asset.usd`); confirm instanceable when valid |
| Transform wrong | Check `mpu` (default 1.0); apply offset before placement; verify with `measure_asset()` |
| Mesh missing | Case-sensitive paths; use absolute; validate via `stage.GetPrimAtPath()` |

### Training

| Issue | Action |
|---|---|
| NaN loss | Lower LR; clip rewards to `[-5, 5]`; check divergent teleop benchmarks |
| Reward flat at 0 | Add dense shaping; reduce reward scale 50%; add input noise for exploration |
| Value divergence | Increase target-net update frequency; prioritized replay; larger batch |

## Operating rules

- Never delete work folders; reuse and branch.
- Always save the `.usd` file; never assume it lives only in memory.
- Validate every render; never deliver black frames.
- Every long-running process must be killable (`pkill` or pidfile).
- No bare `~/` in produced scripts; expand to `$HOME` or `$ENV_VAR`.
- `make_instanceable: true` for all RL robots.
- Call `simulation_app.update()` 5x after a camera switch.
- Never import torch before `timeline.play()`.
- Log GPU memory every epoch.
- Lazy-load HoD assets (decompress on demand).
- Run `skill-distillation` (step 5 of the request loop) at task end. Capture lessons in the relevant SKILL.md, not in scratch memory.
