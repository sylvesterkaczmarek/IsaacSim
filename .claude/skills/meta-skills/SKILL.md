# Meta-Skills — Patterns for Authoring Agent Skills

## Purpose

Structure, compose, and improve agent skills using composition patterns and the Meta-Skilling Framework (Discovery → Practice → Capture → Validation → Iteration).

**Side effects (disclosed):** following this skill may (1) propose updates to skill files on disk — apply only after user confirmation; (2) optionally upload review images to `$IMAGE_SERVER_URL`, which must be localhost-bound (default `http://localhost:8092`), never an external host, and only after user confirmation.

## Prerequisites

- Built Isaac Sim (`$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` or `_build/linux-x86_64/release`).
- NVIDIA GPU with a current driver (`nvidia-smi`).
- Shell env contract from `isaac-sim-orchestrator`: `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR`, `$ISAAC_LAB_DIR`, `$WORKSPACE_DIR`.
- User confirmation before skill-library writes or `$IMAGE_SERVER_URL` uploads.

## Limitations

- Targets Isaac Sim 6 / Kit 110 unless a section states otherwise.
- Does not replace official NVIDIA documentation for unsupported edge cases.
- DISTILL proposes persistent skill updates; it does not silently rewrite the library.

## Troubleshooting

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Extension or import not found | Wrong `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` or stale build | Point env vars at `_build/linux-x86_64/release` or rebuild |
| Black or empty frames | Missing lights or non-RTX render mode | Add dome/key light; confirm RTX / PathTracing settings |
| Hang on stage load or first render | MDL compile or oversized stage | Follow isolation steps in `isaac-sim-troubleshooting` |

Two parts:

1. Composition patterns: structuring and orchestrating skills.
2. Meta-Skilling Framework (MSF): building new skills from zero.


## Core Operating Principle: Distillation Is Not Optional

Every user request follows a six-step loop: ORIENT → PLAN → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → **DISTILL** → DELIVER. The DISTILL step is mandatory as a *proposal*, not a silent write. If a task produced a new insight, workaround, correction, or procedure, draft the skill update (or new skill) and obtain **explicit user confirmation** before modifying skill files on disk. Skill files ARE persistent memory — what isn't written down doesn't exist next session; what is written without review can poison future sessions.

See:
- [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) — the universal request handling loop and skill index
- [`skills/skill-distillation/SKILL.md`](../skill-distillation/SKILL.md) — the full distillation procedure, generalization rule, classification table, and draft-skill promotion gates
- [`references/quality-criteria.md`](references/quality-criteria.md) — standing rubric (keep links one level deep from this file)

# Part 1: Composition Patterns

> **Provenance note:** Several patterns below attribute their origin to skills (`ai-advisor`, `training-ops`, `pbt-system`, `llm-review-protocol`, `collaboration`, `multi-robot-franka`, `sortation-diverter`) from the upstream isaac-claw library that are **not imported into this repo**. The pattern itself is reusable — treat the "Source:" line as historical context, not a navigation pointer.

## 1. Skill Routing

**Pattern:** A top-level orchestrator skill routes to specific sub-skills based on task category.

```
User request → Orchestrator reads context → Routes to specific skill
                                          → Provides shared patterns
```

**Key insight:** The orchestrator doesn't do the work — it identifies which specialist skill should handle it and provides cross-cutting concerns (units, naming, validation).

**Example in this library:** `isaac-sim-orchestrator` — turns natural-language requests into runnable sims and routes to `usd-pipeline`, `isaac-sim-rendering`, `isaac-sim-validator`, `physics-simulation`.

## 2. Chunked Processing

**Pattern:** Prevent context overflow by enforcing batch limits and tier-by-tier processing.

Rules:
- Never process more than N items at once (N=10-20 for complex assets)
- Process in tiers: leaf assets first, then composites, then top-level
- After each chunk, summarize and checkpoint before continuing
- Use explicit "processing X of Y" progress tracking

**When to use:** any time the input set is large enough that bulk-loading risks blowing the context window.

## 3. Quality Gates (from Collaboration / LLM Review)

**Pattern:** Mandatory external review before publishing any output.

Steps:
1. Generate output (render, code, asset)
2. With user confirmation, upload for review only to a localhost `$IMAGE_SERVER_URL` (typically `http://localhost:8092`) for vision LLM ingestion — refuse non-localhost URLs
3. Flood context — include full setup, known issues, what was tried
4. Require minimum score (e.g., 7/10) before sharing
5. Iterate based on prioritized improvement list

**Source:** `llm-review-protocol`, `collaboration` — Grok vision review before posting renders

## 4. Safety Rails for Autonomous Modification (from AI Advisor)

**Pattern:** When an AI agent autonomously modifies configuration:

- Max N× baseline per parameter (e.g., 10×)
- Absolute caps (e.g., 5000)
- No sign flips (penalty can't become reward)
- Audit trail of all changes with before/after
- Drift detection against baseline

**Source:** `ai-advisor` — SafetyRails for reward weight modification

## 5. Multi-Skill Composition (from Warehouse Builder)

**Pattern:** Complex tasks declare skill dependencies explicitly.

```yaml
Dependencies:
  - spatial-reasoning            # all transform math
  - urdf-mjcf-to-usd-conversion       # robot asset import
  - usd-articulation             # multi-link validation
  - physics-simulation           # scene + per-prim physics
  - isaac-sim-rendering          # headless render + tone mapping
```

Each dependency is a complete skill that can be used independently. The composite skill orchestrates when to invoke each one.

## 6. Fleet Orchestration (from Training Ops + PBT)

**Pattern:** Manage distributed compute resources as a fleet.

- Pre-flight validation before any operation
- Zombie process cleanup is mandatory
- SSH-based deployment with git commit tracking
- Centralized monitoring via dashboard
- Population-based training for hyperparameter search

**Source:** `training-ops`, `pbt-system`

## 7. Progressive Disclosure (from Multiple Skills)

**Pattern:** Skill files should front-load the most common operations and put deep reference material later.

Structure:
1. Quick decision guide (table: symptom → action)
2. Most common operations with code
3. Configuration reference
4. Troubleshooting
5. Deep reference / edge cases

**Source:** Observed in the best-structured skills (`spatial-reasoning`, `isaac-sim-troubleshooting`)

# Part 1b: Concise Skills (Anthropic-Compliant)

Hard constraints (Anthropic skill spec):
- `SKILL.md` body ≤ **500 lines**
- `description` ≤ **1024 chars**, third-person, includes WHAT + WHEN + trigger terms
- Cross-references **one level deep** only (no `subdir/subdir/file.md`)
- No hardcoded user paths, IPs, or time-sensitive phrases ("before August 2025")

The patterns below were extracted from a 170 → 132 library consolidation. They are the operational rules to keep the body ≤ 500 lines without losing knowledge.

## 9. Separation of Concerns — Three-File Pattern

A skill that grows past 300 lines almost always has three kinds of content intermixed. Split them into sidecar files.

| Content | Lives in | Rule of thumb |
|---|---|---|
| **What / When / How (procedure)** | `SKILL.md` | Stays in the main file. ≤ 500 lines hard limit. |
| **Executable code** (≥ 20-line blocks, reusable helpers) | `scripts/<name>.py` | Importable module with docstrings. SKILL.md keeps a 1-line call-site example. |
| **Deep reference / case studies / lessons** | `<topic>.md` siblings | E.g. `lessons.md`, `examples.md`, `advanced.md`, `recipes.md`, `workflow.md`. Cross-link from SKILL.md once. |

**Trigger:** if SKILL.md exceeds 500 lines, ≥ 50% of content is code blocks, OR the file has 5+ dated "Learned YYYY-MM-DD" sections → split.

**Naming convention:** sidecars get a single descriptive name (`examples.md`, not `hard_lessons_2026_05.md`). One sidecar per concern; don't fragment further.

## 10. Code-as-Reference, Not Code-as-Skill

A skill's body should describe **what the code does and when to call it**, not be the code. Concrete rules:

- **≥ 20-line code blocks** → extract to `scripts/<name>.py` as a callable function. Replace in SKILL.md with: function signature + 1-line description + path link.
- **5–20-line blocks** → keep inline if they're the *primary* illustration. Drop them if redundant with a sidecar function.
- **≤ 5-line one-liners and config snippets** → embedded is fine. Add a comment with the API version they were validated against.
- **Tables, decision trees, parameter ranges** → keep inline (they're the agent-facing decision support, not the implementation).

Reasoning: a sidecar script can be imported, version-pinned, and tested independently. Embedded code becomes silently stale as upstream APIs evolve. See `skill-distillation` Part 3 ("Code in Skills — Reference, Don't Embed") for the full policy.

## 11. Description Budget — 1024 Chars Is Not Aspirational

The description is what the agent's discovery system uses to decide whether to load the skill. Long descriptions:
1. Hit the 1024-char hard limit and get truncated by tooling
2. Bury the trigger terms in prose

**Structure that fits comfortably:**
- Sentence 1 (≤ 200 chars): what the skill produces or covers
- Sentence 2 (≤ 200 chars): the key concepts/APIs it owns
- Sentence 3 (≤ 200 chars): "Use when …" with 3–5 specific trigger phrases
- Optional: a "See also …" pointer to sibling skills

**Anti-pattern:** description as a TOC. If you find yourself enumerating every section, you're writing the body twice. Save the detail for the body.

## 12. When to Split vs Merge vs Cross-Link

Decision tree for the most common library-evolution question:

```
Two skills overlap. What now?
│
├── One is a strict subset of the other?
│      → DELETE the subset; absorb unique bits into the superset.
│
├── They share substrate but specialize differently?
│      → EXTRACT shared substrate to a third skill; both depend on it.
│         (e.g. `navigation-primitives` shared by runtime nav + SDG)
│
├── They cover the same domain at different abstraction levels?
│      → MERGE into one with a "When to use this skill (vs siblings)" section.
│         (e.g. `physics-simulation` absorbing 10 PhysX/Newton skills)
│
└── They're distinct but frequently used together?
       → CROSS-LINK with explicit RECEIVES from / PRODUCES for sections.
          (e.g. `urdf-mjcf-to-usd-conversion` ↔ `usd-articulation`)
```

**Anti-pattern: narrow-scope project artifacts.** If a skill is named after a specific asset/task (e.g. `multi-robot-franka`, `sortation-diverter`) and its "reusable principle" is "do exactly this thing" — that's a project note, not a skill. Either fold its content into a general parent or delete.

## 13. Hierarchy with Routing, Quality Gates, and Distill-Before-Deliver

**Pattern:** A parent skill routes requests to specialist sub-skills, enforces quality gates at trust boundaries, and mandates distillation before delivery.

```
Request → Router (parent) → Specialist sub-skill → Quality gate → Distill → Deliver
```

Three structural concerns, none optional:

| Concern | Owner | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| **Routing** | Parent SKILL.md routing table | Signal → target → handoff contract |
| **Quality gates** | Parent or dedicated validator sub-skill | Standing checklist + decision tree + feedback loop |
| **Distill-before-deliver** | Phase 4 of the phase plan | Proposed skill update confirmed by user before write |

**When to use:** Any hierarchy with 3+ sub-skills, pipeline stages with intermediate outputs, or domains where delivery defects have been recurring.

**Authoring blueprint:** keep the parent `SKILL.md` as the router, put the standing rubric in [`references/quality-criteria.md`](references/quality-criteria.md), and use one level of sub-skills only. Worked example notes: [`references/skill-hierarchy-authoring.md`](references/skill-hierarchy-authoring.md) (sibling reference — do not nest further reference hops from that file into agent context unless needed).

**Existing implementations:**
- `isaac-sim-orchestrator` — routing table + four-phase plan
- `isaac-sim-validator` — quality gate with evolving criteria
- `skill-distillation` — the distill-before-deliver procedure (confirm before write)

## 14. Environment Variables, Not User Paths

Skills run on different machines. Every absolute path is a portability bug.

| Replace | With |
|---|---|
| `/home/user/IsaacSim` | `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` |
| `/home/user/Projects/.../assets/...` | `$SIMREADY_ASSETS/...` |
| `localhost:8095` | `$KB_SERVICE_URL` (default `http://localhost:8095`) |
| `192.168.0.109:8092` | `$IMAGE_SERVER_URL` (placeholder OK; never bake the IP) |
| `C:\_Data\exts\content-pipeline\cip.bat` | `$CIP_ROOT/exts/content-pipeline/cip.bat` (Windows skills declare platform in a preamble) |

The orchestrator skill owns the env-var contract; per-skill files reference vars, never declare values. See `isaac-sim-orchestrator` § Environment.

# Part 2: Meta-Skilling Framework (MSF)

A systematic, repeatable process for developing new skills from zero to competent in any domain. Designed for an AI agent with session-based memory loss where skill files ARE the persistent memory.

## When to Use MSF
- Starting to learn any new tool, domain, or capability
- Building a skill hierarchy (e.g., Blender → modeling, materials, rigging...)
- Reviewing whether an existing skill needs iteration

## The Five Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery — define what you need to learn and why
1. Identify the need — what problem does this skill solve?
2. Define scope — boundaries; one skill or a hierarchy?
3. Break down sub-skills — list components, create hierarchy if complex
4. Research resources — official docs, API references, tutorials
5. Set competence goals — specific tasks you should be able to perform when done
6. Check existing skills — do any of your skills overlap? Link and reuse.

**Output:** Initial SKILL.md with purpose, scope, hierarchy, resources, goals.

### Phase 2: Practice — build hands-on competence through structured experimentation
1. Follow the learning path — foundational, then advance
2. Do small practical tasks — don't just read; build
3. Take notes AS you go — commands, workflows, gotchas
4. Identify patterns — what's repeatable, what can be scripted
5. Track challenges — tag what's hard; these become iteration targets

**Output:** Raw practice notes, initial scripts, identified patterns.

### Phase 3: Capture — convert raw learnings into structured, reusable knowledge
1. Organize — convert practice notes into structured sections
2. Standardize — follow the SKILL.md template (below)
3. Save scripts — working code in `scripts/`. Reference docs in `references/`.
4. Version — start at v0.1, increment on significant updates
5. Link related skills — cross-reference parent/child/sibling skills

**Critical Rule:** If it's not in the file, it doesn't exist next session.

### Phase 4: Validation — prove the skill actually works
1. Test it — perform a real task using only what's documented
2. Check against goals — can you do what Discovery said you should?
3. Identify gaps — tag as "Validation Gaps" for iteration
4. Get feedback — from user, validator, or test results

### Phase 5: Iteration — refine and expand based on real usage
1. Review gaps at session start
2. Research solutions
3. Update and version
4. Expand scope — add sub-skills once core is solid
5. Re-validate

## Skill Hierarchy Pattern

```
domain/
├── SKILL.md              # Parent: overview, skill tree, progress tracker
├── sub-skill-1/
│   ├── SKILL.md          # Sub-skill: focused docs
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── references/
└── sub-skill-2/...
```

Rules: parent has the full skill tree with status indicators; sub-skills link back to parent; track dependencies; master foundational sub-skills before dependent ones.

## SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  [1-3 sentences: what, when to use, triggers]
---

# [Skill Name]

## When to Use This Skill
- [task 1]
- [task 2]

## Related / Integration Points
- RECEIVES from: [skill] → [data]
- PRODUCES for: [skill] → [data]

## Core Concepts
[Organized knowledge]

## Key Workflows
[Step-by-step procedures with code]

## Decision Trees
[Branching logic for "it depends" situations]

## Failure Modes & Recovery
For each major workflow:
- FAILURE: [what goes wrong]
- SYMPTOMS: [how you notice]
- CAUSE: [why]
- RECOVERY: [fix]
- PREVENTION: [how to avoid]

## Expert Intuition
- Rules of thumb
- Smell tests
- Proportional judgments

## Context Matrix
| Context | Behavior Change |
|---------|----------------|

## Environment Requirements
Pre-flight checks and tool versions.

## Iteration Log
- v0.1 [date]: Initial capture
```

## Cold-Start Expertise Patterns

Goal: BE competent the moment you read the skill file.

- **Executable Knowledge Blocks (EKBs)**: `IF [condition] THEN [action] BECAUSE [reasoning]`
- **Decision Trees**: embed branching logic directly
- **Failure Mode Catalog**: FAILURE/SYMPTOMS/CAUSE/RECOVERY/PREVENTION
- **Worked Examples**: at least 2 per workflow, input→decisions→output
- **Context Matrix**: same skill across different situations
- **Confidence Tags**: `verified`, `probable`, `theoretical`

## Anti-Patterns

- Learning without capturing — you WILL forget
- Starting too broad — focus on one sub-skill at a time
- Skipping validation — untested = unreliable
- Copy-pasting tutorials without adapting to YOUR context
- Ignoring existing skills — always check for overlap first
- Perfectionism before practice — rough working skill beats perfect plan

## Session Start Protocol

1. Read this file to remember the framework
2. Read the PARENT skill for the domain you're working in
3. Read the specific SUB-SKILL you're focusing on
4. Check Challenges & Gaps — that's your TODO
5. Pick up where the last session left off
