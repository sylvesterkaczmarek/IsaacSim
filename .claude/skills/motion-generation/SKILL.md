# Motion Generation

## Purpose

Build obstacle-aware arm and mobile-base motion with the motion_generation controller substrate; cuMotion with RMPflow is the reference arm implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Built Isaac Sim (`$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` or `_build/linux-x86_64/release`).
- NVIDIA GPU with a current driver (`nvidia-smi`).
- Shell env contract from `isaac-sim-orchestrator`: `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR`, `$ISAAC_LAB_DIR`, `$WORKSPACE_DIR`.

## Limitations

- Targets Isaac Sim 6 / Kit 110 unless a section states otherwise.
- Does not replace official NVIDIA documentation for unsupported edge cases.

## Troubleshooting

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Extension or import not found | Wrong `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` or stale build | Point env vars at `_build/linux-x86_64/release` or rebuild |
| Black or empty frames | Missing lights or non-RTX render mode | Add dome/key light; confirm RTX / PathTracing settings |
| Hang on stage load or first render | MDL compile or oversized stage | Follow isolation steps in `isaac-sim-troubleshooting` |

Owns the generic `isaacsim.robot_motion.experimental.motion_generation` (`mg`)
substrate and the phase-machine workflow for obstacle-aware end-effector
motion. The motion-generation controller is pluggable: cuMotion
(`isaacsim.robot_motion.cumotion`) is the reference implementation here. PINK and
Lula are also motion-generation controllers but are not yet documented in this
skill; see the stack-selection table in `manipulation-ik` to choose.

Shared substrate lives in sibling skills:

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Python-server launch, asset-root checks, screenshots, markers, run videos, final object-pose oracle | `isaac-sim-remote` |
| Grasp frames, contact-only gates, physical grasp validation, IK-stack selection | `manipulation-ik` |
| Mobile-base planning, footprints, differential-drive/Ackermann kinematics, chase cameras | `navigation-primitives` |
| Dynamic object collision, rigid bodies, materials, physics readback | `physics-simulation` |
| Headless rendering and video capture | `isaac-sim-rendering` |
| Final output QA | `isaac-sim-validator` |

## Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Arguments |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/control_loop.py` | Control loop | see script --help |
| `scripts/cumotion_setup.py` | Cumotion setup | see script --help |
| `scripts/frames_and_grasping.py` | Frames and grasping | see script --help |
| `scripts/inspect_scene.py` | Inspect scene | see script --help |
| `scripts/phase_machine.py` | Phase machine | see script --help |
| `scripts/world_binding.py` | World binding | see script --help |

## Running scripts

From agent runtimes that expose skill execution helpers, invoke helpers with `run_script()`:

```python
run_script("scripts/control_loop.py", args=["--help"])
```

From a built Isaac Sim tree, run the same file with `./python.sh` (Linux) or `python.bat` (Windows) from `_build/*/release`, or execute shell helpers directly when they do not require the simulator.

## Scope Rules

- Use current experimental Isaac Sim APIs. Do not add Cortex, deprecated
  manipulator, or legacy `omni.isaac.*` compatibility unless the user asks for
  migration. `RobotState` and the world-binding substrate live in
  `isaacsim.robot_motion.experimental.motion_generation`; the non-experimental
  `isaacsim.robot_motion.motion_generation` is deprecated.
- Prefer Python-server iteration when available. A standalone script can be the
  deliverable shape, but validate the scene logic, frame alignment, and phase
  gates through the Python server unless the user explicitly asks to run the
  standalone launcher.
- Do not trust shell exit code alone. Inspect stdout/logs for tracebacks,
  `RuntimeError`, explicit pass/fail JSON, and phase completion.
- Keep one-off probes in `/tmp`. Only keep reusable, domain-specific helpers
  under this skill.
- A standalone script is run by a person, so it must open a visible window
  by default. Gate headless mode and any frame capture / video encoding behind
  explicit opt-in flags (for example `--render OUTPUT.MP4` switches to headless
  capture). Never set `--headless` or `SimulationApp(headless=...)` to
  default-on, and never capture frames or encode a video unless asked. Iterating
  on the Python server (above) is the separate, headless path for tuning.

## Workflow

1. Inspect robot prim path, DOF/link names, controller tool frames, object
   pose/AABB, physics schemas, and collision APIs.
2. Define the task frame before tuning: tool frame, physical grasp/action
   point, object semantic axis, and target axis.
3. Build world binding and controller (`references/world-binding.md`,
   `references/cumotion.md`).
4. Run an explicit phase machine (`references/control-loop.md`) with target,
   reset policy, convergence predicate, timeout, and trace line per phase.
5. Validate measured outputs from the actual run. For dynamic manipulation,
   use `manipulation-ik` and `physics-simulation` for grasp/contact gates.

## Controller wiring (quick rules)

Full code in `references/world-binding.md` + `references/control-loop.md`;
controller construction in `references/cumotion.md`. The non-negotiables:

- Build joint and site state by name, not by index assumptions
  (`robot.dof_names`, the controller's reported tool/site frames).
- Call `controller.reset(estimated, setpoint, t=0.0)` before the first
  `forward()` and after intentional target discontinuities.
- Pass controller clock time into `forward(...)`; do not pass `dt`.
- Apply positions, velocities, and efforts from the desired joint state when
  present.
- Synchronize the world binding every control frame
  (`update_world_to_robot_root_transforms(...)` then `synchronize_transforms()`).
- Keep the grasped object out of the tracked obstacle set, or the controller
  plans around it.
- For simple reactive obstacle avoidance, bind obstacles through
  `CumotionWorldInterface` / `WorldBinding` and keep the transport phase in the
  `RmpFlowController.forward()` loop. Do not switch to graph planning or author
  bypass/clearance targets unless the demo explicitly needs global planning.
- Tune obstacle inflation in small steps; large clearance buffers can improve
  avoidance but break grasp/place convergence.
- Log requested planner clearance and measured runtime clearance separately;
  they are not the same.
- Start with example-scale c-space/posture weights; large bias can hide weak
  task-space motion.
- For rendered demos, validate the recorder-enabled run, not only a non-captured
  metrics run.

## Mobile-Base Controller Pattern

For mobile bases, route planning and wheel geometry to
`navigation-primitives`. Use this skill only for `RobotState` / controller
integration, and apply joint velocities/efforts/positions rather than writing
root transforms as the success path for a physics run.

## Frame Discipline

Most failures are frame errors. Log these separately (see
`references/frames-and-grasping.md`):

- controller tool frame, such as `tool0` or `wrist_3_link`
- desired and measured tool local `+Z` axis
- visible fingertip midpoint or suction tip
- task grasp point on the object
- object origin, center of mass, and AABB center
- object semantic axis and final target axis
- target pose sent to the controller

Command the tool pose that makes the physical grasp point land on the object
grasp point. If the controller drives a flange/tool frame but the gripper
contacts at a fingertip or suction cup, calibrate the tool-local offset in the
approach orientation and freeze it through close/lift.

Before coding a flip or placement task, prove the final pose is geometrically
feasible for the grasp. If a requested final pose requires an upward-facing
gripper or below-surface wrist, change the grasp strategy before tuning
controller gains or timeouts.
