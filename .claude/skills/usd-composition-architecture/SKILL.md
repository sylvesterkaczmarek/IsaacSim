# USD Composition Architecture for Isaac Sim

## Purpose

Author sim-ready USD with layered payloads (base, instances, materials, physics, robot) following NVIDIA composition conventions.

## Prerequisites

- Built Isaac Sim (`$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` or `_build/linux-x86_64/release`).
- NVIDIA GPU with a current driver (`nvidia-smi`).
- Shell env contract from `isaac-sim-orchestrator`: `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR`, `$ISAAC_LAB_DIR`, `$WORKSPACE_DIR`.

## Limitations

- Targets Isaac Sim 6 / Kit 110 unless a section states otherwise.
- Does not replace official NVIDIA documentation for unsupported edge cases.

## Troubleshooting

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Extension or import not found | Wrong `$ISAAC_SIM_DIR` or stale build | Point env vars at `_build/linux-x86_64/release` or rebuild |
| Black or empty frames | Missing lights or non-RTX render mode | Add dome/key light; confirm RTX / PathTracing settings |
| Hang on stage load or first render | MDL compile or oversized stage | Follow isolation steps in `isaac-sim-troubleshooting` |

## When to use

- Build new robot or environment assets.
- Restructure an existing asset with the Asset Transformer.
- Optimize RL training startup time and VRAM.
- Diagnose physics edits in a USDA that aren't taking effect.
- Debug joint limits, mass, or solver parameters.
- Create variants of an existing asset (configs, materials).

## Core Concept: One Binary Crate, Many USDA Layers

Isaac Sim's recommended asset structure splits a robot into one binary geometry crate plus a set of ASCII layers, composed by an `interface.usda`:

```
{robot}/
    interface.usda                         <- Final composed asset (entry point)
    payloads/
        base.usda                          <- Simulation-ready hierarchy + xforms
        geometries.usdc                    <- Mesh data ONLY (binary crate)
        instances.usda                     <- Mesh + material + collider assembly
        materials.usda                     <- Material defs (MDL bindings)
        Textures/                          <- Texture assets
        robot.usda                         <- Isaac robot schema + metadata
        Physics/
            physics.usda                   <- Neutral USD/Newton physics
            physx.usda                     <- PhysX-only tuning (sublayers physics.usda)
            mujoco.usda                    <- MuJoCo-only tuning (sublayers physics.usda)
```

USD `payload` arcs enable **lazy loading** — a payload is only loaded when explicitly requested. This is the key to headless RL optimization.

## File Format Decision Guide

The rule is simple: **binary crate (`.usdc`) for raw mesh data, USDA for everything else.** The Asset Transformer's `GeometriesRoutingRule` enforces this split automatically.

| Layer | Format | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `geometries.usdc` | `.usdc` (binary crate) | Mesh topology, points, indices — high-volume numeric data, never edited by hand |
| `base.usda` | `.usda` | Hierarchy and transforms — diffable, hand-editable |
| `instances.usda` | `.usda` | References meshes + applies materials + collision approximation choice |
| `materials.usda` | `.usda` | Material prims, MDL shader bindings — readable look-dev |
| `physics.usda` / `physx.usda` / `mujoco.usda` | `.usda` | Joint limits, masses, solver params — frequent tuning |
| `robot.usda` | `.usda` | Isaac robot schema metadata and relationships |
| `interface.usda` | `.usda` | Composition arcs (references, payloads, variants) — the entry point |
| Texture assets | original (PNG, JPG, EXR) + `.mdl` | Stored under `Textures/` |
| Archive/portable | `.usdz` | Single-file distribution (iOS AR) |

**Rationale:** Mesh arrays are large and never hand-edited, so binary crate wins on size and load time. Everything else is small, frequently inspected, and benefits from being diffable in version control and editable by both humans and agents.

## Producing This Structure: Asset Transformer

Use the Asset Transformer (Isaac Sim Structure profile) to convert an imported URDF/MJCF asset into the layout above. The relevant rules:

- `GeometriesRoutingRule` — extracts mesh prims to `geometries.usdc` (binary), creates instanceable references in `instances.usda`. Set `save_base_as_usda: true` to keep `base` ASCII.
- `MaterialsRoutingRule` — deduplicates materials into `materials.usda`, copies textures to `Textures/`.
- `SchemaRoutingRule` — splits physics, physx, mujoco, and robot schemas into their respective USDA layers.
- `InterfaceConnectionRule` — generates `interface.usda` with the composition arcs.

Refer to the Asset Transformer Rules Reference for the full pipeline.

## Physics USDA Schema

### physics.usda — Joint and Mass Definitions

```usda
#usda 1.0

def PhysicsRevoluteJoint "FL_hip_joint" {
    uniform token physics:axis = "X"
    float physics:lowerLimit = -46.0
    float physics:upperLimit = 46.0
    rel physics:body0 = </Robot/trunk>
    rel physics:body1 = </Robot/FL_hip>
}

def RigidBodyAPI "trunk" {
    float physics:mass = 4.713
    point3f physics:centerOfMass = (0.012, 0.002, -0.002)
    float3 physics:diagonalInertia = (0.0120, 0.0220, 0.0270)
}
```

### physx.usda — PhysX-Only Tuning

```usda
#usda 1.0

def PhysxJointAPI "FL_hip_joint" {
    float physxJoint:maxJointVelocity = 20.0
    float physxJoint:jointFriction = 0.05
}

def PhysxRigidBodyAPI "trunk" {
    bool physxRigidBody:enableGyroscopicForces = true
    float physxRigidBody:maxDepenetrationVelocity = 10.0
    int physxRigidBody:solverPositionIterationCount = 32
    int physxRigidBody:solverVelocityIterationCount = 1
}
```

`physx.usda` typically sublayers `physics.usda` so PhysX-only opinions stack on top of the neutral physics definition.

## Headless RL Optimization: Skip Appearance

The biggest RL training startup optimization: **don't load appearance payloads**.

When Isaac Lab loads a robot for RL:
1. Loads: `interface.usda` + base + physics layers (joints, masses, collision shapes).
2. Skips: `materials.usda` and `Textures/` (irrelevant for physics sim).

```python
ArticulationCfg(
    spawn=sim_utils.UsdFileCfg(
        usd_path=f"{ASSETS_ROOT}/Robots/MyRobot/interface.usda",
        activate_contact_sensors=True,
        # Do NOT load appearance payloads for RL
        visual_material=None,
    )
)
```

## Composition Arc Precedence

USD applies opinions in this order (last wins for most properties):

```
Sublayers < Reference < Payload < VariantSet < Direct opinions
```

If your physics USDA changes "don't take effect", check that the override opinion is in a higher-precedence layer.

## Common Debugging

```python
from pxr import Usd
# Find which layer is setting a specific property
attr = prim.GetAttribute("physics:mass")
for spec in attr.GetPropertyStack(Usd.TimeCode.Default()):
    print(f"  Layer: {spec.layer.GetDisplayName()} = {spec.default}")
```
