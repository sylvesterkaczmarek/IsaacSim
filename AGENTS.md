# Isaac Sim — Agent Guide

`skills/` is the canonical, agent-agnostic location for SKILL.md-format workflow guides.

Route to skills by the `description` field in each `SKILL.md` frontmatter, which states when that skill applies. Load only the skills the task needs; do not bulk-load the library.

Read [`skills/SKILLS.md`](skills/SKILLS.md) when the task spans several skills, or when you need the composition order between them. It is a routing map, not a prerequisite for every conversation.

Cursor and Claude Code load the same skills via their respective pointer mechanisms (`.cursor/rules/agent_skills.mdc`, `CLAUDE.md`). For Codex (this file), the skills are background context — refer to them when the user's task overlaps a skill's subject.

### Repo-wide rules

[`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/) holds the `*.mdc` style and policy rules (C++ codestyle, Python codestyle, docs style, extension structure, build instructions, pip packaging, ...). Load them on demand when editing code that falls under their domain.

Skills are authored once under `skills/`. `.claude/skills/` contains symlinks into `skills/` so Claude Code's native skill discovery works without duplication. `.cursor/skills/` is retired.
