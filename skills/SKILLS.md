# Isaac Sim Skills Index

Routing map for the skills under `skills/`. Read it when a task spans several
skills or you need the order they compose in. For single-skill routing you do
not need this file: every `SKILL.md` carries a `description` in its YAML
frontmatter stating when to use it, and agent platforms load those
automatically.

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` plus optional `scripts/` and
`references/`.


Shared shell-variable contract (`$ISAAC_SIM_DIR`, `$ISAAC_LAB_DIR`,
`$WORKSPACE_DIR`): declared in
[`isaac-sim-orchestrator/SKILL.md`](isaac-sim-orchestrator/SKILL.md).

## Categories

Names and links only. What each skill does, and when to use it, is stated in the
`description` in its frontmatter, which is what agents route on and is loaded
without reading this file.

## Composition

Which skill feeds which. This is the part no single `SKILL.md` can state.

- **Robot to simulation:** `urdf-mjcf-to-usd-conversion` then `usd-articulation`
  (structure it with `usd-composition-architecture`) then `physics-simulation`,
  then `isaac-sim-orchestrator` to integrate sensors and capture.
- **Synthetic data:** static scenes go `isaac-sim-sensor` then
  `data-collection-sim`; mobile robots go `navigation-primitives` then
  `mobility-gen` (record, then replay and render).
- **Mobile navigation:** `navigation-primitives` is the substrate under both
  `isaac-sim-robot-navigation` (live control) and `mobility-gen` (SDG);
  `occupancy-map` supplies the grid, `isaac-sim-ros2-bridge` exposes it to Nav2.
- **Manipulation:** `manipulation-ik` for grasp frames and contact validation,
  `motion-generation` when the path must avoid obstacles.
- **Delivery:** `isaac-sim-rendering` produces frames, `isaac-sim-validator`
  gates them, `skill-distillation` captures what was learned.

## When stuck

- [`isaac-sim-troubleshooting`](isaac-sim-troubleshooting/SKILL.md) — hangs, freezes, performance stalls
- [`isaac-sim-validator`](isaac-sim-validator/SKILL.md) — refuses bad deliverables before they reach the user
