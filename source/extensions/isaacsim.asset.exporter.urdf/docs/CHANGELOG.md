# Changelog

## [2.2.6] - 2026-08-31
### Fixed
- Apply composed parent and robot scale to exported primitive geometry dimensions.
- Export X-axis and Y-axis cylinder and capsule orientations correctly.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-08-28
### Fixed
- Reconstruct products of inertia correctly from rotated USD principal axes.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-08-24
### Fixed
- Ignore unauthored or non-finite PhysX DriveAPI `maxForce` values when exporting URDF joint effort limits.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-08-20
### Changed
- Pin `usd-exchange` to version 2.3.0 for reproducible standalone installs.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-08-17
### Fixed
- Export native USD joint effort limits using PhysX DriveAPI `maxForce` when available, falling back to the `urdf:limit:effort` attribute otherwise.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-07-29
### Fixed
- Read joint velocity limits from canonical `newton:velocityLimit` metadata while preserving finite legacy `urdf:limit:velocity` values for backward compatibility.
- Re-apply the root prim's world **scale** (the component that `GetInverse()` removes) to the frame-relative transforms, so it propagates to all links
- Robustness: strip scale from stored link frames, so an inherited scale cannot cancel the re-applied root scale

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-23
### Added
- Material export: read OmniPBR/MDL parameters (diffuse, roughness, metallic, emissive) from the `.mdl` source (resolved against its authoring layer) when not authored as USD shader inputs; USD inputs take precedence.
- Write roughness/metallic to `.mtl` (`Pr`/`Pm`) and bake a diffuse texture's average color into `Kd`, so material appearance round-trips on reimport.

### Fixed
- Rebase the physical root link's transform relative to the robot prim so ancestor Xform offsets no longer leak into exported joint origins.
- Skip geometry-bearing Xforms spuriously tagged `IsaacSiteAPI`
- `_fmt`: use significant-figure formatting so tiny valid inertias (~1e-10) are preserved instead of rounded to `0`.
- Classify visual/collision meshes by computed (inherited) purpose
- Export unbounded USD revolute joints (`±inf` limits) as URDF continuous joints.
- `export_duplicate_ghost_links`: rename site links that collide with their parent link name instead of always skipping them.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-07-21
### Added
- `UsdToUrdfConverter`: optionally export colliding site ghost links with numeric suffixes.

### Changed
- Migrated robot asset references from `Isaac/Robots/` to `Isaac/Robots_Multiphysics/` for the new multiphysics-ready USDA assets.

### Fixed
- Skip site ghost links whose resolved name matches an existing URDF link (e.g. multiphysics UR10e ``base_link/base_link``).

## [2.1.2] - 2026-07-15
### Fixed
- Explicitly set physics variant in unit test
- Joint friction is now imported to newton:friction rather than physxjoint:jointFriction

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-15
### Added
- Export `NewtonMassAPI` `newton:inertia` tensor directly to URDF `<inertia>`, taking precedence over principal-axis reconstruction.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-02
### Added
- `UsdToUrdfConverter.convert`: add a callback for modifying the completed URDF XML before it is written.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-06-09
### Fixed
- Fix linter errors and missing or incomplete docstrings, and update `python_api.md`.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- Fixed bug when nested rigid body are not discovered when the link holding the articulation root api is not a rigid body

## [2.0.3] - 2026-05-05
### Changed
- Preview image

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-30
### Changed
- Use codeless physx schema

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- Preserve mesh scale when exporting instanceable geometry containers (e.g. `<link>/geometry` Xform with `instanceable=true` and a non-unit `xformOp:scale`, as in collected Isaac Sim assets like `franka.usd`); the scale is now emitted on the URDF `<mesh scale=...>` attribute instead of being silently dropped
- Replace `Usd.Prim.GetAncestorsRange` (C++-only API) with a `GetParent` walk in mesh prototype path resolution; the previous code raised `AttributeError` whenever a non-instanced mesh was exported

### Changed
- `matrix4_to_origin` now decomposes the matrix via `Gf.Transform` so RPY is computed from the unscaled rotation; `ExtractRotation` on a scaled matrix produced incorrect angles

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-09
### Changed
- Rewrite as physics-graph-driven converter (UsdToUrdfConverter)

### Added
- Round-trip drive breadcrumbs: `isaac:source_drive` XML comments preserve DriveAPI gains (stiffness, damping, maxForce, targetPosition), MjcActuator parameters, and PhysxJointAPI armature across URDF export/import

### Fixed
- DriveAPI values no longer incorrectly populate URDF `<dynamics>`, `<limit effort>`, or `<calibration reference_position>` — these URDF elements now only contain passive joint properties per the URDF-to-USD concept mapping
- Split into API extension (this) and UI extension (isaacsim.asset.exporter.urdf.ui)
- Remove nvidia-srl-usd-to-urdf dependency
- Remove omni.physics.physx dependency from core API
