 *        consumed by hololink's `NativeVb1940Sensor::read_calibration_from_eeprom()`.
 * @details
 * The 256-byte region holds 30 big-endian IEEE-754 doubles in this fixed order:
 *
 *     [L_fx, L_fy, L_cx, L_cy, L_k1, L_k2, L_p1, L_p2,

 *      Rx,   Ry,   Rz,   Tx,   Ty,   Tz]
 *
 * Real hardware stores this in the rig EEPROM; in sim we serve it from the same I²C
 * channel via the modified `Vb1940Emulator` so unmodified staging code sees the same
 * calibration path.

 * For stereo VB1940 (and any multi-sensor configuration), the real Leopard Eagle board exposes
 * one Hololink + multiple VB1940 imagers at different I²C bus offsets. A hololink receiver
 * enumerates a *single* board via BootP and then opens sensor 0 and sensor 1 on it. To mirror
 * that in the emulator, two `HSBSender` instances configured with the
 * same `ipAddress` must share a single `HSBEmulator` (rather than each spinning up its own board
 * on the same address).
 *
 * Lifetime is managed via `shared_ptr` — the emulator is created lazily on the first
 * `HSBSender::connect()` for a given IP and destroyed automatically when the last sender for
 * that IP drops its reference. `takenSensorIds` is the per-emulator slot table; duplicate
 * `sensorId` requests on the same IP are rejected at connect time.
