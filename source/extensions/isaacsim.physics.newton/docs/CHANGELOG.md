# Changelog

## [1.0.6] - 2026-08-28
### Fixed
- Initialize joint coordinates from authored rigid-body poses before forward kinematics, while preserving the nearest equivalent revolute-angle branch.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-08-25
### Fixed
- Initialize from the first physics scene declaring exactly one Newton solver API.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-08-25
### Fixed
- Use the supported Carb warning logger when Newton initialization is skipped.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-22
### Deprecated
- Stop exporting the legacy Python tensor implementation as `isaacsim.physics.newton.tensors`; use the dedicated extension instead.

### Fixed
- Cache rigid-body center-of-mass data at view indices to prevent out-of-bounds writes for subset views.
- Use the dedicated Newton tensor backend in hydroelastic contact tests.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-21
### Fixed
- Report Newton USD parser warnings at warning severity in Isaac Sim logs.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-21
### Fixed
- Preserve nested rigid-body transforms when stopping MuJoCo with **Reset Simulation on Stop** disabled by safely authoring the final simulation pose to USD. XPBD and VBD now warn and leave USD unchanged for this unsupported mode.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-20
### Added
- Add solver-selection APIs and VBD solver configuration.

### Changed
- Select and configure Newton solvers through physics scene schemas.

### Removed
- Remove schema-backed fields from `MuJoCoSolverConfig` and `XPBDSolverConfig`; configure them on the physics scene.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-11
### Fixed
- Fix stale XPBD contact data in Newton tensor contact queries.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-11
### Changed
- Upgraded the Newton pip package to 1.5.0.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-06
### Changed
- Upgraded Newton pip package to 1.5.0rc2, mujoco to 3.11.0, and mujoco-warp to 3.11.0
- Updated newton-usd-schemas to 0.4.1
- Updated omni.warp.core extscache pin to 1.16.0
- Removed `MuJoCoSolverConfig.ls_parallel`; Newton 1.5 no longer accepts it
- Use `Control.joint_target_q` / `joint_target_qd` (Newton 1.5 rename)
- Use `ModelFlags` for Newton 1.5 solver refresh notifications
- Use pyramidal MuJoCo friction cones for stable policy locomotion with Newton 1.5

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-04
### Added
- `/exts/isaacsim.physics.newton/load_textures` setting. Enable it when using Newton's own viewer.

### Changed
- Newton no longer loads material textures by default. They feed only Newton's viewer, and loading them dominated stage initialization.

### Fixed
- `omniverse://` texture paths no longer fail to load. Remote URLs resolve through the local cache.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-28
### Added
- `HydroelasticConfig.buffer_mult_broad`, `buffer_mult_iso`, and `buffer_mult_contact` to resize the hydroelastic collision buffers reported in overflow warnings.
- `CollisionConfig.rigid_contact_max` to set the contact capacity of the collision pipeline.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-23
### Fixed
- Improve the MuJoCo error for rigid bodies without joints.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-21
### Changed
- Upgraded Newton pip package to 1.4.0 and mujoco-warp to 3.10.0.2
- Removed newton-actuators dependency

## [0.10.3] - 2026-07-20
### Fixed

- Recapture the simulation CUDA graph when the physics timestep changes, keeping simulation dynamics and reported simulation time consistent.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-07-14
### Fixed

- Pre-play articulation property queries now report link/DOF/joint metadata matching the runtime Newton view regardless of where `ArticulationRootAPI` is authored (rigid-body Xform, fixed root joint, or container)
- Sibling articulations no longer leak into a queried articulation's results.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-07-13
### Fixed

- Scale Newton body transforms to the USD stage units when updating Fabric.
- Preserve composed USD world scales when writing Newton body transforms to Fabric.
- Emit an error when the USD stage `metersPerUnit` is not 1.0.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-10

- Updated omni.warp.core extscache pin to 1.15.0

## [0.8.3] - 2026-06-29

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-16

- Making newton respect resetOnStop carb setting

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-09

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-05
### Changed

- Upgraded Newton pip package from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1

## [0.7.14] - 2026-05-27
### Added

- Perform device check before running simulation in simulation_manager to prevent double initialization when device changes

## [0.7.13] - 2026-05-21
### Added

- Document Newton asset compatibility limitations and workarounds.
- Regression tests for Newton initialization error handling.

## [0.7.12] - 2026-05-19

## [0.7.11] - 2026-05-18
### Changed

- Add return type annotations and mypy type:ignore comments across all source files to pass mypy and ruff linting

## [0.7.10] - 2026-05-12
### Changed

- Updated newton pip dependencies to newton 1.2.0rc3, mujoco-warp 3.8.0.2, newton-usd-schemas 0.2.0

## [0.7.9] - 2026-05-08
### Fixed

- Resolve pre-physics articulation link, joint, and DOF metadata by parsing the USD subtree with Newton's importer, mirroring the runtime articulation view's filtering of root and fixed joints, so `Articulation.dof_names` and the corresponding indices are available before physics is initialized and match the order produced once the simulation view is created. Results are cached per `(stage_id, prim_path)` and invalidated on USD stage close events.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-05-04
### Fixed

- Use the newton collision pipeline as default instead of mujoco
- MuJoCo solver: run `Model.collide` once per `simulate()` when `use_mujoco_contacts` is false (Newton collision); skip Newton collide when `use_mujoco_contacts` is true; call `SolverMuJoCo.update_contacts` after every `simulate()` so `contacts.force` and related fields match the solved MuJoCo state (required for tensor contact APIs, not only when MuJoCo runs collision)

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-27
### Fixed

- Fix unbounded growth of `contact_callbacks` and `step_callbacks` lists when repeatedly subscribing and unsubscribing callbacks. Replace tombstone-based lists with dict-based storage so unsubscribed slots are reclaimed and iteration cost is O(active callbacks)

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-23
### Fixed

- Try to load USD with flattened stage when composition cycles are present

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed

- Run the first simulation step without CUDA graph capture. Warp's link-time optimization compilation for `tile_matmul` / `tile_cholesky` can fail on the first attempt but succeeds on retry. When the first compilation happens inside `wp.capture_begin`, the failure is recorded into the CUDA graph, producing wrong simulation results on all subsequent steps. Skipping graph capture on the first step lets these transient failures resolve before any graph is recorded.
- Forward the user-provided `dt` into `simulate()` when recording the CUDA graph so step times match the requested timestep
- Route `set_dof_actuation_forces` and `get_dof_actuation_forces` through `control.joint_f` so applied joint efforts drive the simulation

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-17
### Changed

- Update tensor frontend import paths for `omni.physics.tensors` package restructuring

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-15
### Fixed

- Fix stale model references in all tensor view classes (`NewtonSimView`, `ArticulationSet`, `RigidBodySet`, `RigidContactSet`, and their frontend wrappers)
- Fix `shape_gap` default for static colliders from 0.1m to 0.0
- Add `cleanup_stale_newton_index` to `FabricManager` to remove leftover `newton:index` from prims no longer tracked as dynamic bodies
- Add bounds checking in `set_fabric_transforms` kernel to skip out-of-range body indices

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-10
### Removed

- Remove the `isaacsim.core.utils` and `omni.isaac.ml_archive` dependencies

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-01
### Changed

- get_simulation_time_steps_per_second returns int rather than float to comply with omni.physics.core bindings

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-17
### Fixed

- Newton contact tensor API: apply force sign convention in net and matrix kernels (add for shape0, subtract for shape1) so net contact forces match PhysX expectations.
- Populate contact points from MuJoCo world-space positions when Newton Contacts do not provide rigid_contact_point0/1.

### Changed

- Contact force scaling in tensor view uses SimulationManager.get_physics_dt() instead of Newton stage sim_dt.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-17
### Added

- CTRL_DIRECT actuator PD control via tensor API: bridge `set_dof_stiffnesses`, `set_dof_dampings`, and `set_dof_position_targets` to MuJoCo actuator parameters (gainprm, biasprm, ctrl) and set biastype=AFFINE so robot policies (e.g. Go2) work with Newton when USD uses `mujoco:actuator` rather than `physics:driveAPI`.
