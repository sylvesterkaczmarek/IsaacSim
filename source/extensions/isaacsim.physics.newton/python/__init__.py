"""Isaac Sim Newton Physics Extension.

This extension integrates the Newton physics engine into Isaac Sim, providing
high-performance GPU-accelerated physics simulation with support for multiple
integrators (XPBD, MuJoCo, Featherstone, Semi-Implicit).

Submodules:
    - tensors: Tensor-based interface for Newton physics (see isaacsim.physics.newton.tensors)
