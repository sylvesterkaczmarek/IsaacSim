# Changelog

## [1.2.3] - 2026-07-11
### Changed
- Use experimental core stage helpers and the shared behavior script attachment helper in UI tests.
- Add a dedicated startup test configuration.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-07
### Changed
- Use supported package-root imports for cross-extension APIs.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-09
### Fixed
- Fix linter errors and missing or incomplete docstrings.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- Subscribe to the `isaacsim.replicator.behavior.EXPOSED_VARS_CHANGED` event and refresh the property window when exposed variables are created or removed. This replaces the direct `omni.kit.window.property.request_rebuild()` calls previously issued from the core behavior scripts, allowing the core extension to be decoupled from any UI module and run headless.
- Guarded the `omni.kit.window.property` import so the UI extension can still be imported in headless contexts (the event handler becomes a no-op).
