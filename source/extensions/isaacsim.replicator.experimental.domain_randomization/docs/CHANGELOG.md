# Changelog

## [1.2.10] - 2026-08-19
### Fixed
- `get_reset_inds`: raise `RuntimeError` when the domain-randomization context is not initialized.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-08-14
### Fixed
- Export the extension `IExt` so stage close clears physics-view registries and the randomization context.
- Connect `numSamples` only when the distribution node exposes that input so sequence distributions can author graphs.

## [1.2.8] - 2026-08-13
### Fixed
- Skip tendon attribute randomization on reset for articulations with no fixed tendons so later writes on the same view still apply.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-07-21
### Changed
- Migrated robot asset references from `Isaac/Robots/` to `Isaac/Robots_Multiphysics/` for the new multiphysics-ready USDA assets.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-07-07
### Changed
- Update the generated Python API inventory.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-06-09
### Fixed
- Fix linter errors and missing or incomplete docstrings, and update `python_api.md`.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- Fix module-level physics view state not cleaned up on stage close/reload, causing stale views to accumulate across sessions

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-20
### Fixed
- Fix `OgnWritePhysicsArticulationView` `KeyError` when randomizing tendon attributes on robots with no fixed tendons

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-18
### Changed
- Added return type annotations, imperative-mood docstrings, and `__all__` definitions

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-04
### Changed
- Added Overview.md, python_api.md and updated docstrings

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-13
### Changed
