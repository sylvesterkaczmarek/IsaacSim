### Changed
- Routed controller warnings through `isaacsim.common.logging` to remove the direct Carbonite dependency.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-29

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24
### Added
- `AckermannController`: single-robot Ackermann steering controller wrapping `ControllerAckermann`, with site-setpoint and direct-command modes, configurable forward/rotation axes, per-axle radii and track widths, speed and angle clamping, CUDA graph capture, and stateful theta hold near zero speed.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-22
### Added
- `DifferentialDriveController`: single-robot differential drive controller wrapping `ControllerDifferentialDrive`, with configurable forward/rotation axes, speed clamping, and CUDA graph capture.
