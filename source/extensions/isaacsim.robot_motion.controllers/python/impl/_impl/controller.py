    """Abstract interface for a single Newton control law.

    Every concrete control law (joint impedance, differential IK, …) subclasses
    :class:`Controller` directly. There is no framework-level composition: users
    who want to combine multiple control laws call each one's :meth:`compute`
    in sequence themselves.

    Subclasses are responsible for:

    - :meth:`is_graphable`: predicate the user can query to decide CUDA-graph
      capture.
    - :meth:`input`, :meth:`output`: allocate fresh duck-typed containers
      holding only the live ports declared at construction. Baked-in arrays
      (gain ports given a :class:`wp.array` rather than an attr name) are
      stored on the controller and do **not** appear on the input struct.
    - :meth:`compute`: read the input struct's live arrays, run kernels, write
      the output struct's live arrays. Writes are slot-replacing (``=``, not
      ``+=``); composing laws is the user's job.
