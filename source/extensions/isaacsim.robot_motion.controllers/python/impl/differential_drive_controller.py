    """Single-robot differential drive controller.

    Converts a control-point velocity setpoint into left / right wheel velocity
    commands using the differential drive kinematic model::

        omega_L = (2 * v - omega * wheel_base) / (2 * wheel_radius)
        omega_R = (2 * v + omega * wheel_base) / (2 * wheel_radius)

    The scalar commands are extracted from the named site in
    ``setpoint_state.sites`` by projection:

    - ``v     = dot(forward_direction,  site.linear_velocity)``
    - ``omega = dot(rotation_direction, site.angular_velocity)``

    The control point is interpreted as the point midway between the two front
    wheels, which may differ from the robot's root (e.g. centre of mass).

    Both direction vectors are normalized at construction time and must be at
    least 89.9 degrees apart.

    Args:
        robot_joint_space: Ordered list of all joint names in the robot.
        left_wheel_joint: Name of the left wheel joint in ``robot_joint_space``.
        right_wheel_joint: Name of the right wheel joint in ``robot_joint_space``.
        wheel_radius: Wheel radius [m].
        wheel_base: Lateral wheel-to-wheel distance [m].
        control_point_name: Name of the site in ``setpoint_state.sites`` from
            which linear and angular velocities are read.
        forward_direction: Robot forward axis in the body frame. Normalized at
            construction.
        rotation_direction: Yaw axis in the body frame. Normalized at construction.
            Must be at least 89.9° from ``forward_direction``.
        max_linear_speed: Forward/backward speed limit [m/s]. When ``None``, no
            limit is applied.
        max_angular_speed: Yaw-rate limit [rad/s]. When ``None``, no limit is applied.
        max_wheel_speed: Per-wheel angular velocity limit [rad/s]. When ``None``, no
            limit is applied.
        device: Warp device for internal buffers. When a CUDA device is used, a
            CUDA graph is captured at construction.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If either direction vector is zero, not 3-element, or the two
            directions are less than 89.9 degrees apart.
        ValueError: If ``wheel_radius`` or ``wheel_base`` is not strictly positive.
        ValueError: If any of ``max_linear_speed``, ``max_angular_speed``, or
            ``max_wheel_speed`` is provided and not strictly positive.
