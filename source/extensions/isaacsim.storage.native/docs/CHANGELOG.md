# Changelog

## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-01
### Changed
- Use Asset Region Profile naming for regional asset routing and add an explicit default profile.

## [1.10.4] - 2026-09-01
### Fixed
- Asset-root validation accepts roots containing either the Isaac or NVIDIA asset tree.

## [1.10.3] - 2026-08-31
### Changed
- Update the regional asset profile to the Isaac Sim 6.1 asset root.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-08-26
### Fixed
- `verify_asset_root_path`: validate versioned HTTP asset roots when `version.txt` is unavailable.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-08-24
### Changed
- Update the default Isaac Sim asset root to the production 6.1 URL.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-28
### Added
- Support selecting an asset region profile via the `ISAACSIM_ASSET_REGION_PROFILE` environment variable.
- Ship a regional profile that serves reads from a regional CDN while list and stat go direct to object storage, and that sets the asset root and USD Search endpoint.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-07-21
### Fixed
- Accept configured asset roots when the Storage provider does not support directory metadata checks.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-06-09
### Fixed
- Fix linter errors and missing or incomplete docstrings, and update `python_api.md`.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- `path_join`: treat any URL-scheme path (including `file://`) as forward-slash on Windows
- `path_join`: normalize backslashes in relative path components to forward slashes, fixing traversal failures when `omni.client.list` returns Windows-style paths on Nucleus/remote URLs

## [1.9.1] - 2026-04-30
### Fixed
- `path_join` uses forward-slash concatenation for all URL schemes, not just `omniverse://`, fixing backslash-corrupted paths on Windows when the assets root is an `https://` URL
- `path_join` `../` traversal uses `rsplit` instead of `os.path.dirname` to avoid the same backslash issue
