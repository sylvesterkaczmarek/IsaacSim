isaacsim.common.array
=====================

``isaacsim.common.array`` provides a lightweight multi-dimensional array type for
exchanging tensor data across C++ and Python boundaries in Isaac Sim. It is not a
general-purpose math library; it covers the construction, inspection, slicing,
device transfer, and dtype conversion operations needed to move data between
simulation components.

Design
------

An ``Array`` combines a contiguous element buffer with a ``Shape``, a ``DType``, and
a ``Device``. The buffer is managed through shared ownership, so copying an ``Array``
shares the allocation rather than duplicating it. Use ``clone()`` when an independent
copy is required.

The three supporting value types are:

- ``Shape`` — an ordered sequence of signed 64-bit dimension sizes. Supports
  NumPy-style broadcasting rules and -1 dimension inference for ``reshape()``.
- ``DType`` — an element type token covering ``bool``, the fixed-width integer types
  from ``<cstdint>``, ``float``, and ``double``.
- ``Device`` — a compute target, either the CPU (ordinal -1) or a CUDA GPU
  (non-negative ordinal). ``DeviceGuard`` provides RAII device switching.

CUDA operations load the platform CUDA runtime dynamically. The runtime must be
discoverable through the host library search path as ``libcudart.so`` on Linux or
``cudart64_12.dll`` on Windows.
