/**
 * @brief Marks a kernel library entry point as resolvable by name at runtime.
 * @details
 * CudaKernel loads this library with `LoadLibrary`/`dlopen` and resolves its entry points with
 * `GetProcAddress`/`dlsym`, so they must appear in the binary's export table. Windows exports
 * nothing from a DLL without `__declspec(dllexport)`; the ELF attribute keeps the symbols visible
 * if the target ever adopts hidden visibility.
