``isaacsim_common`` contains shared infrastructure used by the standalone Isaac Sim
libraries. It defines common array and device types, exception types, logging,
profiling, and string utilities for native and Python code.

Use these modules when multiple libraries need the same low-level contracts. The
distribution does not depend on another Isaac Sim library distribution.
