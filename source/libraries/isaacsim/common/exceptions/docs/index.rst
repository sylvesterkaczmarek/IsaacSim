isaacsim.common.exceptions
==========================

``isaacsim.common.exceptions`` defines the C++ and Python exception hierarchy raised by Isaac Sim's own validation
code. Every exception derives from a common ``IsaacSimException`` base, so callers can catch any Isaac Sim exception
generically, or catch a specific subtype to inspect the structured data it carries.

Four concrete exceptions are provided:

- ``PrimPathError`` -- a USD prim path does not refer to a usable prim. Carries the offending path.
- ``PrimPathStringError`` -- a string does not parse as a valid USD prim path. Carries the offending string.
- ``AttributeNameError`` -- a caller referenced an attribute name that does not exist or is not accepted. Carries the
  offending attribute name.
- ``ValueTypeError`` -- a value's type does not match the type expected for an attribute. Carries the attribute name,
  the expected type, and the actual type.

Each exception formats a human-readable message from its fields, available through ``what()`` in C++ and
``str(exception)`` in Python. The C++ base derives from ``std::exception``, so callers may also catch
``std::exception`` when they only need a generic failure signal.

Python usage
------------

.. code-block:: python

    from isaacsim.common.exceptions import PrimPathError, IsaacSimException

    try:
        ...
    except PrimPathError as error:
        print(error.prim_path)
    except IsaacSimException:
        # Handles any other Isaac Sim exception.
        raise

See :doc:`api_cpp` and :doc:`api_python` for language-specific references.
