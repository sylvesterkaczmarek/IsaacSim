=========
C++ guide
=========

.. isaacsim-libraries-api-guide-start

Include ``isaacsim/common/logging/Logging.hpp`` and link ``isaacsim::common-logging``. Store one ``Logger`` for each
feature-library channel:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <isaacsim/common/logging/Logging.hpp>

    using isaacsim::common::logging::LogLevel;
    using isaacsim::common::logging::Logger;

    Logger logger("isaacsim.simulation");
    logger.log(LogLevel::eInfo, "Simulation initialized");

``Logger`` copies its non-empty channel during construction without selecting a backend, allowing a native host to
attach after feature loggers are created. Records have four delivered severities: ``eVerbose``, ``eInfo``,
``eWarning``, and ``eError``. Carbonite owns filtering and output policy; the facade has no callback registry,
per-logger policy, or last-error state.

The C++ macros use the pinned header-only ``{fmt}`` dependency, submit without a second message copy, and preserve
source location metadata:

.. code-block:: cpp

    ISAACSIM_LOG_INFO(logger, "Loaded {} objects", objectCount);
    ISAACSIM_LOG_WARN(logger, "Falling back to backend {}", backendName);
    ISAACSIM_LOG_WARN_ONCE(logger, "The fallback backend is active");
    ISAACSIM_LOG_DEPRECATION_ONCE(logger, "old_api() is deprecated; use new_api() instead");

``ISAACSIM_LOG_WARNING_ONCE`` and its ``ISAACSIM_LOG_WARN_ONCE`` alias submit at most one admitted record for each
macro call site, including when multiple threads reach that site concurrently. A filtered call does not consume the
call site's record. ``ISAACSIM_LOG_DEPRECATION_ONCE`` provides the same behavior at ``WARNING`` severity and leaves the
deprecation message unchanged. All formatting macros check admission before evaluating their formatting arguments.
Use ``Logger::isEnabled`` when expensive work must happen before the macro call or when calling ``Logger::log``
directly.

For code that already owns source metadata, pass ``SourceLocation`` to ``Logger::log`` or ``Logger::report`` directly:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using isaacsim::common::logging::SourceLocation;

    logger.log(LogLevel::eInfo, message, SourceLocation{ sourceFile, sourceFunction, sourceLine });

The logger borrows the three pointers only for the call. A default-constructed ``SourceLocation`` omits the metadata.

Use ``report`` for result-style output that must remain visible regardless of Carbonite's configured log level. The
formatted macro also preserves source metadata:

.. code-block:: cpp

    logger.report("Calculation complete");
    ISAACSIM_REPORT(logger, "Calculation result: {:.2f}", result);

Both forms synchronously write and flush ``[channel] message`` to standard output, then submit the unprefixed message
to Carbonite at ``INFO``. Carbonite still controls admission and routing of the log record, so console routing of
``INFO`` may display the message a second time.

Formatting failures are ignored because logging is supplemental. Callers that need compile-time format-string
checking with the pinned fmt 7 dependency can wrap a literal with ``FMT_STRING``.

.. _isaacsim-common-logging-cpp-configuration:

Application-level configuration
================================

``GlobalLoggingConfig`` is an application-level patch over Carbonite's process-wide default logger and named channels.
Empty optionals leave current scalar settings unchanged, so applications can update one destination without resetting
the others:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using isaacsim::common::logging::ConfigureResult;
    using isaacsim::common::logging::GlobalLoggingConfig;
    using isaacsim::common::logging::configureGlobalLogging;

    GlobalLoggingConfig config;
    config.filePath = "logs/isaac-sim-${pid}.log";
    config.fileAppend = true;
    config.fileLevel = LogLevel::eInfo;
    if (configureGlobalLogging(config) != ConfigureResult::eSuccess)
    {
        // Invalid configuration or unavailable backend.
    }

An empty ``filePath`` string disables file logging. Create parent directories before configuring the destination.
Carbonite resolves relative paths from the working directory at configuration time and does not report file-open
failures through its configuration interface. Configure this process-wide policy only from the application entry
point.

Applications can also patch Carbonite's per-channel enablement and threshold. ``eOverride`` applies the supplied
value, ``eInherit`` clears the corresponding channel override, and ``eUnchanged`` leaves it untouched:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using isaacsim::common::logging::ChannelLoggingConfig;
    using isaacsim::common::logging::ChannelSettingBehavior;

    ChannelLoggingConfig channel;
    channel.channel = "isaacsim.sensors.camera";
    channel.enabledBehavior = ChannelSettingBehavior::eOverride;
    channel.enabled = false;

    GlobalLoggingConfig config;
    config.channels.push_back(channel);
    configureGlobalLogging(config);

Enablement and minimum-level behaviors are independent. Carbonite performs the filtering; ``Logger`` does not keep a
local policy copy.

Logging calls are ``noexcept`` and return ``void``. Use ``isaacsim::common::logging::flush()`` only when the application
needs to drain Carbonite's process-wide logging backend explicitly. Logger destruction does not flush global state.

The declarations and Doxygen comments in ``Logging.hpp`` are the authoritative C++ reference.
