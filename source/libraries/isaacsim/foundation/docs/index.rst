===================
isaacsim_foundation
===================

``isaacsim_foundation`` provides the shared Universal Scene Description (USD) layer
for standalone Isaac Sim libraries. It includes OpenUSD and OVStage adapters, typed
scene-object wrappers, physics prim wrappers, and common stage, prim, and semantics
utilities.

Use the adapter that matches the USD runtime owned by your application. Higher-level
libraries build on these modules instead of depending directly on runtime-specific
scene access throughout their implementations.
