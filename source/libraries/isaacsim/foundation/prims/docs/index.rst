isaacsim.foundation.prims
=========================

``isaacsim.foundation.prims`` provides physics-aware prim wrappers built on top
of the base classes in ``isaacsim.foundation.objects``.  All classes in this
module extend :py:class:`~isaacsim.foundation.objects.Xform` and operate on one
or more USD prims resolved from the active stage.

Physics prims
-------------

:py:class:`~isaacsim.foundation.prims.Articulation` wraps prims that carry
the ``PhysicsArticulationRootAPI`` and provides a unified interface for
articulation structure (links, joints, DOFs) and their physical properties
(gains, limits, friction, drive types, targets).

:py:class:`~isaacsim.foundation.prims.ColliderBody` applies the
``PhysicsCollisionAPI`` and exposes collision approximation, contact/rest
offsets, torsional patch radii, and enable/disable controls.

:py:class:`~isaacsim.foundation.prims.RigidBody` applies the
``PhysicsRigidBodyAPI`` and ``PhysicsMassAPI`` schemas and exposes mass,
density, linear/angular velocity, gravity, and sleep properties.
