isaacsim.foundation.usd.openusd
===============================

``isaacsim.foundation.usd.openusd`` is a thin C++ facade over OpenUSD.
It exposes stage lifecycle, prim authoring, schema queries, variant
selection, and attribute I/O through a stable ABI based on opaque integer
stage handles and standard C++ types. Callers never hold raw
``UsdStageRefPtr`` or ``SdfPath`` objects across the boundary, so they do not
need to link against OpenUSD directly.
