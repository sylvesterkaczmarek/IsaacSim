isaacsim.foundation.usd.ovstage
===============================

``isaacsim.foundation.usd.ovstage`` is a thin C++ facade over ovstage.
It exposes stage lifecycle, prim authoring, schema queries,
and attribute I/O through a stable ABI based on opaque integer
stage handles and standard C++ types. Callers never hold raw
``ovstage_instance_t`` or ``ovx_primpath_t`` instances across the boundary,
so they do not need to link against ovstage directly.
