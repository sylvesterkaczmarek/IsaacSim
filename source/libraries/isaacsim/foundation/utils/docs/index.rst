isaacsim.foundation.utils
=========================

``isaacsim.foundation.utils`` provides shared utilities for stage management,
prim authoring, semantics labelling, and backend selection used across Isaac Sim
foundation modules.

Backend selection
-----------------

A thread-local ``BackendGuard`` activates a named backend (e.g. ``"usd"``,
``"tensor"``) for the duration of a scope.  ``getCurrentBackend()`` returns
the active backend, falling back to the first entry of a caller-supplied
supported-backends list when none is set.

Stage, prim, and semantics utilities
-------------------------------------

Helper functions for common USD operations — managing default stage IDs,
querying prim hierarchies, and reading or writing semantics attributes —
are grouped into the ``stage``, ``prim``, and ``semantics`` sub-modules.
All utilities that do not accept an explicit stage instance operate on the
active stage for the calling thread, or the process-global default stage.
