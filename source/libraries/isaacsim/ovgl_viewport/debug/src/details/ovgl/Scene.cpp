 * byte-identical -- so three paths meant three reads, three PNG inflates and
 * three GL textures of the same image.
 *
 * MEASURED on this tree, franka_factory at 960x700, at the 2048 default cap,
 * medians of 5 interleaved runs a side (the A/B is OVGL_TEXTURE_DEDUP below, so
 * it is one binary against itself):
 *
 *      by path       19 GPU textures / 19 decodes / 389.3 MB of mip chains
 *                    meshloop 5778.2 ms, step 0 total 7.05 s
 *      by content     7 GPU textures /  7 decodes / 133.3 MB
 *                    meshloop 2083.0 ms, step 0 total 3.07 s, of which 30.3 ms
 *                    is digesting the 230.6 MB of source bytes it reads
 *
 * and the rendered frame is BYTE-IDENTICAL across all ten runs (one md5,
 * 5ed45cea10933aa3b7504224b2e2d816) -- deduplicating byte-identical inputs is a
 * pure optimisation, so any pixel difference would mean something merged that
 * should not have. 19 -> 7 rather than 19 -> 11 because this scene binds only 19
 * of the mirror's 23 PNGs: 18 CubeBox copies of 6 uniques (all 4096-square,
 * capped to 2048 here) plus one 1024-square plastic normal map. Two further
 * paths are missing from the mirror and negative-cache, which is why the
 * profile line reports paths=21.
 *
 * HASH THE SOURCE BYTES, NOT THE DECODED PIXELS. Hashing decoded pixels would
 * save the upload and the VRAM but not the decode, and the decode is the whole
 * cold start -- a PNG has no partial-resolution decode, so the only way not to
 * pay for it is to not run it. Reading the file to hash it costs nothing extra
 * because the decode had to read it anyway (stbi_load's stdio path is replaced
 * by read-then-stbi_load_from_memory, which is also what the packaged .usdz
 * branch already did).
 *
 * THE KEY IS (CONTENT, IS_SRGB), NOT CONTENT ALONE. GpuOpenGles.c picks the GL
 * internal format per texture from is_srgb -- GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8 vs GL_RGBA8
 * (GpuOpenGles.c:1417-1418) -- so ONE image bound to a colour slot and to a data slot
 * legitimately wants TWO GPU textures. Merging those on content alone silently
 * corrupts one of them: a normal/ORM map sampled through sRGB, or an albedo
 * sampled linear and rendering too dark. The two entries still share ONE decode
 * and ONE pixel buffer (shared_ptr), so the disagreement costs GPU memory only,
 * never CPU time, and it is the format -- not the pixels -- that differs.
 *
 * HOW THIS COMPOSES WITH THE DECODED-SIZE CAP (box_downsample_rgba8, :811). The
 * cap is NOT in the key and must never be: it runs BETWEEN the decode and the
 * memo/content-cache inserts, and it is a pure function of (decoded w, decoded
 * h, the process-static max_texture_size()), so identical source bytes decode to
 * identical dimensions and therefore take an identical cap decision. Two copies
 * of one image can never end up one capped and one not. This ordering is also
 * the only one that pays: the digest is taken BEFORE the decode precisely so a
 * content hit can skip the decode, and a hit that skipped the decode has nothing
 * to cap -- it adopts the already-capped pixels of the entry it joined. Putting
 * the cap after registration, or the digest after the decode, breaks one of
 * those two properties each.
 *
 * COLLISIONS. The digest is MurmurHash3 x64_128 over the bytes, paired with the
 * byte length, so a false merge needs a 128-bit collision that also matches the
 * length. That is the same bet every content-addressed cache makes. It is NOT
 * backed by a byte comparison, deliberately: verifying would mean either
 * retaining every unique source buffer for the whole build (+79.5 MB of RSS on
 * this corpus, measured over its 7 unique images) or re-reading the twin on
 * every hit (the same 230.6 MB again, spent to confirm decodes we already know
 * we want to skip). Murmur is not cryptographic, so a hostile asset could in
 * principle be built to collide; the failure mode is one texture rendered in
 * place of another, not memory unsafety. */

 *
 *  - the path comes from ovstage, not a resolver walk. ovpopulation mirrors an asset attribute

 *    there is no scene_dir to guess against and no recursive file-index fallback to maintain.
 *  - USDZ IS supported, because that resolved path is USD's packaged form,
 *    "/abs/thing.usdz[0/tex.png]". A usdz is a zip whose entries are STORED (never deflated)
 *    and 64-byte aligned precisely so readers can mmap/point at them, so pulling the bytes out
 *    is a local-header walk and a memcpy — which is what makes the Apple sample assets, whose
 *    textures ALL live inside the package, actually show their materials.

/* ── Decoded-texture size cap (port of material.c's
 * materials_set_max_tex_size, :773-869) ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fork hard-capped EVERY texture at 512 px for its low-VRAM GLES target.
 * ovgl caps at kDefaultMaxTexSize and exposes the knob OVGL_MAX_TEX_SIZE=<px>;
 * an explicit 0 disables the cap entirely, and a negative or non-numeric value
 * falls back to the default rather than silently uncapping (an unparseable knob
 * must not be the one that puts 1.3 GB back on the GPU). Knob shape follows
 * OVGL_GRID_OVERLAY / OVGL_SS (Ovgl.cpp:931-940) and OVGL_PROFILE_LOAD (:112) --
 * read once into a function-local static, so it cannot change mid-process and
 * split the decode memo between capped and uncapped pixels for the same key.
 *
 * WHY 2048 IS THE DEFAULT. Measured over the mirrored franka corpus (23 PNGs,
 * 328.3 Mpx, IHDR-read): nineteen 4096x4096 maps are 1275.1 MB of the 1313.1 MB
 * total, i.e. 97%, and the whole rest of the corpus is 38 MB. One halving of
 * those nineteen takes the set to 356.8 MB -- a 3.7x cut for a single mip step
 * off the source. The remaining steps are worth far less (2048->1024 saves
 * another 264 MB, 1024->512 only 69 MB) while the fidelity cost grows: 512
 * measures max 5/255 on 1.53% of pixels, 1024 max 2/255. A cap of 4096 is a
 * no-op on this corpus -- nothing exceeds it -- so 2048 is the first setting
 * that does anything at all, and it does most of the available work.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT FREE, AND IT IS NOT BYTE-IDENTICAL TO AN UNCAPPED BUILD. Any
 * frame using a >2048 texture changes. That is a deliberate trade, not an
 * oversight; set OVGL_MAX_TEX_SIZE=0 to render at authored resolution.
 *
 * BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS DOES NOT BUY. The cap runs AFTER stbi_load, because
 * a PNG has no partial-resolution decode: the full-size image must be
 * inflated + unfiltered before anything can be thrown away. It saves upload
 * bandwidth and VRAM. It does NOT save the cold-start PNG decode, which is
 * where franka_factory's ~9 s first step actually goes -- the first halving
 * still reads every source texel, so it costs a little decode-side time.
 *
 * THE BIGGER LEVER IS NOT THIS, AND IT IS NOW IN. 18 of those 19 textures are
 * six SimReady CubeBox maps stored three times over (cubebox_a02/a03/a04),
 * byte-identical by md5 -- pure duplication that a PATH key cannot see, so three
 * paths meant three decodes and three uploads. The content-hash dedup above
 * collapses them with zero fidelity loss and cuts the decode time this cap
 * cannot: at this 2048 default, 19 -> 7 textures, 19 -> 7 decodes, 389.3 -> 133.3
 * MB of mip chains and step 0 from 7.05 s to 3.07 s.
 *
 * ORDERING CONTRACT WITH THAT DEDUP. The cap must run after the decode and
 * before the memo/content-cache inserts, which is exactly where the call below
 * sits. It stays out of the dedup key because it is a pure function of the
 * decoded dimensions and a process-static cap, so identical source bytes always
 * take the identical cap decision -- two copies of one image cannot end up one
 * capped and one not. Content hits return before the decode and so adopt the
 * already-capped pixels of the entry they join. */

         * and 45.2. After the fix ovgl's own mean is 188.7,159.6,117.1 in all four,

         * The untextured controls on the same plate are BYTE-identical before and
         * after (MAE 1.780 unauthored, 2.001 with the constant at white), which is
         * the 0.2 default this block deliberately leaves alone.
         *
         * Keyed on the texture actually BINDING, not on the attribute being
         * authored, because tex::texture_isvalid is false for a texture that
         * failed to load: franka_factory's ground_plane authors an UNRESOLVABLE

         * this is what OmniPBR*.mdl's own source says, and AdvancedPBR /
         * DrivesimPBR / OmniSurface are different files nobody has measured. They
         * are left EXACTLY as they were, verified on this same plate with only the
         * MDL basename swapped (ovgl-only, three arms each): constant at white ->
         * mean 188.7,159.6,117.1; at (0.5) -> 144.2,113.2,77.6 (MAE 43.486 vs the

         * have collapsed the three arms onto one frame -- which is exactly what the
         * OmniPBR control does here (MAE 0.000 between all three).
         *
         * That third arm also records a SEPARATE, pre-existing gap this change
         * deliberately does not touch: on a NON-OmniPBR MDL family with a bound
         * diffuse texture and no authored constant, base_color is never written at

         * post-pass at material.c:4766 keyed on "is base_color still the default
