     *
     * On Linux, NVIDIA's libglvnd refuses to make an EGL context current while a
     * GLX context is current ANYWHERE IN THE PROCESS. Measured 2026-07-26 against
     * omni.ui (robot-ovui's viewer shell), which draws through GLFW on a GLX
     * context: eglMakeCurrent returns EGL_FALSE with EGL_BAD_ACCESS, so
     * egl_headless_create fails and the whole viewport renders nothing.
     *
     * Three measurements pin the mechanism, and rule out the two theories that
     * were in the code before:
     *   - after omni.ui.init(): eglGetCurrentContext() == NULL but
     *     glXGetCurrentContext() != NULL. The prior mitigation here was
     *     eglReleaseThread(), which only touches EGL state and therefore could
     *     never help.
     *   - creating the context on a FRESH thread, with neither EGL nor GLX current
     *     on it, still fails -- so this is NOT thread-local contention, and moving
     *     the render to a worker thread does not fix it.
     *   - glXMakeCurrent(dpy, None, NULL) on the thread holding GLX, then
     *     egl_headless_create -> succeeds.
     * Vulkan is NOT the trigger: vkCreateInstance + vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices
     * followed by egl_headless_create succeeds.
     *
     * suspend: if a GLX context is current on the calling thread, save it in
     * thread-local state, unbind it, and return 1. Returns 0 -- and touches
     * nothing at all -- when no GLX context is current, which is every headless
     * and usdview-adopted lane, so those stay bit-identical.
     * restore: undo a suspend that returned 1 (release our EGL context first, then
     * re-bind the saved GLX one). A no-op when suspend did not fire. */
    int egl_headless_suspend_foreign(void);
    void egl_headless_restore_foreign(void);
