=======================
isaacsim_ovgl_viewport
=======================

``isaacsim_ovgl_viewport`` provides an interactive OpenGL viewport for testing and debugging standalone Isaac Sim
applications. The ``isaacsim.ovgl_viewport.debug`` module renders an OVStage scene and provides camera navigation,
headless frame rendering, and frame capture.

Use this library when you need to inspect standalone scene or simulation state. It is a concrete debugging tool, not a
generic rendering abstraction.
