C++ API reference
=================

.. isaacsim-libraries-api-guide-start

Link against ``isaacsim::ovsim-api``.

``#include <isaacsim/ovsim/api/Factory.hpp>``

Namespace: ``isaacsim::ovsim::api``

Client factory
==============

.. code-block:: cpp

    // name is "in-process" / "local", or "grpc".
    types::Implementation client = makeClient("in-process");

    // gRPC clients accept an optional configuration map (e.g. connection target).
    types::Implementation remote = makeClient("grpc", { { "endpoint", "grpc://localhost:50051" } });

Implementation
==============

``#include <isaacsim/ovsim/api/Types.hpp>``

``types::Implementation`` bundles the ``control`` (``authoring`` + ``simulation``) and ``data``
interfaces returned by :cpp:func:`isaacsim::ovsim::api::makeClient`. Each member is a struct of ``std::function``
fields with the same signatures as the free functions in ``isaacsim::foundation::ovsim`` and
``isaacsim::physics::ovsim``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    types::Implementation client = makeClient("in-process");

    bool created = client.control.authoring.createStage();
    OutputValueType values = client.data.read(paths, "attributeName");
