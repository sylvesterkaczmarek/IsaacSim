``isaacsim-physics`` provides backend-neutral simulation registration, simulation
management, and tensor views. Physics engine implementations
are supplied by the separate ``isaacsim-physics-engines`` distribution.

The distribution separates the backend-neutral contracts into three modules:

* ``isaacsim.physics.registration`` defines the engine registration contracts and
  shared vocabulary.
* ``isaacsim.physics.manager`` drives registered simulations and creates tensor
  views.
* ``isaacsim.physics.entities`` provides higher-level entities backed by the
  manager's tensor views.

Use this distribution when application code must remain independent of a specific
physics engine implementation.
