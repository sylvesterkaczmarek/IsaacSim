C++ guide
=========

.. isaacsim-libraries-api-guide-start

All declarations live in the ``isaacsim::physics::entities`` namespace.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <isaacsim/physics/entities/PhysicsEntity.hpp>
    #include <isaacsim/physics/entities/RigidBodyEntity.hpp>
    #include <isaacsim/physics/entities/ArticulationEntity.hpp>

    using namespace isaacsim::physics::entities;

Every wrapper is constructed from a physics engine name and one or more USD
prim paths.  Paths may be a single string or a ``std::vector<std::string>``,
and may contain regular expressions.  Methods act on the whole batch; the
optional ``indices`` argument restricts them to a subset of the wrapped prims.

Batched quantities use ``N`` for the number of selected prims, ``D`` for the
number of degrees of freedom, ``L`` for the number of links, and ``T`` for the
number of fixed tendons.

.. note::

    The wrapped prims must be part of a started simulation for data access to
    succeed.

.. _isaacsim-physics-entities-api-cpp-physicsentity:

PhysicsEntity
=============

``PhysicsEntity`` is the base class.  It binds the prim paths to a physics
engine entity view and exposes named data buffers as batched arrays.  The set
of valid buffer names depends on the entity kind and the engine backing it:

.. code-block:: cpp

    PhysicsEntity entity("physx", "rigid-body", "/World/Cube.*");

    size_t count = entity.numPrims();
    array::Array transforms = entity.getData("transforms");
    entity.setData("transforms", transforms);

Include: ``<isaacsim/physics/entities/PhysicsEntity.hpp>``

.. _isaacsim-physics-entities-api-cpp-rigidbodyentity:

RigidBodyEntity
===============

``RigidBodyEntity`` extends ``PhysicsEntity`` with rigid body state and
properties: world poses, linear and angular velocities, external force and
torque application, masses, inertia tensors, centers of mass, and per-body
simulation and gravity toggles:

.. code-block:: cpp

    RigidBodyEntity bodies("physx", { "/World/Cube0", "/World/Cube1" });

    auto [positions, orientations] = bodies.getWorldPoses();
    bodies.setVelocities(/*linearVelocities=*/linear);
    bodies.applyForces(forces);
    bodies.setEnabledGravities(flags, /*indices=*/only0);

Setters that take several optional components require at least one of them to
be defined, and throw ``std::invalid_argument`` otherwise.

Include: ``<isaacsim/physics/entities/RigidBodyEntity.hpp>``

.. _isaacsim-physics-entities-api-cpp-articulationentity:

ArticulationEntity
==================

``ArticulationEntity`` extends ``PhysicsEntity`` with articulation state and
properties.  Topology accessors (``numDofs``, ``dofNames``, ``numLinks``,
``linkNames``, ...) describe the kinematic tree, and the name-to-index helpers
resolve DOF, joint, and link names into the ``dofIndices`` / ``linkIndices``
arguments taken by the batched accessors:

.. code-block:: cpp

    ArticulationEntity robots("physx", "/World/Robot.*");

    array::Array arm = robots.getDofIndices({ "panda_joint1", "panda_joint2" });
    robots.setDofPositionTargets(targets, /*indices=*/std::nullopt, arm);
    robots.switchDofControlMode("effort", std::nullopt, arm);

The remaining methods cover root pose and velocity, DOF state and drive
configuration, link mass properties, dynamics quantities, and fixed tendon
properties.  ``jacobianMatrixShape`` and ``massMatrixShape`` report the
per-articulation shapes returned by ``getJacobianMatrices`` and
``getMassMatrices``; both depend on whether the articulation base is fixed.

.. note::

    DOF, joint, and link USD paths and types (``dofPaths``, ``dofTypes``,
    ``jointPaths``, ``jointTypes``, ``linkPaths``) are not exposed by the
    tensor API and throw ``std::runtime_error``.

Include: ``<isaacsim/physics/entities/ArticulationEntity.hpp>``
