Include the headers under ``isaacsim/physics/manager`` and link
``isaacsim::physics-manager``.

``PhysicsSimulation.hpp`` contains simulation lifecycle and stepping operations.
``PhysicsSceneQuery.hpp``, ``PhysicsInteraction.hpp``, and
``PhysicsBenchmark.hpp`` contain their corresponding process-wide operations.
The ``tensors`` headers define the concrete manager-side tensor views.

The declarations and Doxygen comments in the public headers are the authoritative
C++ reference.
