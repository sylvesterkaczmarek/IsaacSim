/**
 * @brief Initializes all active physics backends from a stage.
 *
 * Each backend consumes the stage representation it supports. The caller retains ownership of `ovstage`, and this
 * function does not extend its lifetime. A null `ovstage` together with a null or empty `usdIdentifier` is valid input
 * that requests initialization of an empty scene. The manager does not detach an existing stage before dispatching
 * initialization; each backend controls replacement of any stage it already holds.
 *
 * The caller must keep a non-null `ovstage` alive until every backend that accepted it has detached. A successful call
 * to `close()` normally establishes this when all participating backends expose correct cleanup callbacks. A failure
 * result alone does not prove detachment when a backend omits cleanup or attachment-status callbacks.
 *
 * If a backend fails, successfully initialized backends that expose a close callback are closed in reverse order. The
 * function returns `InitializeResult::eFailedDirty` when a close callback fails or throws, or when the failed backend's
 * attachment-status callback reports an attached stage or throws. Otherwise, it returns `InitializeResult::eFailed`.
 * These results describe manager-observed cleanup; they cannot guarantee absolute attachment state when callbacks are
 * absent or report inaccurate state.
 *
 * @param[in] ovstage Opaque pointer to a caller-owned `ovstage_instance_t`, or `nullptr` when unavailable.
 * @param[in] usdIdentifier Numeric USD stage-cache identifier, such as `"123"`, or `nullptr` or an empty string when
 *                          unavailable. The value is interpreted as an identifier, not as a file path.
 * @return `InitializeResult::eOk` when every participating initialization callback succeeds,
 *         `InitializeResult::eFailed` when initialization fails without an observed cleanup problem, or
 *         `InitializeResult::eFailedDirty` when cleanup fails or its status cannot be determined.
 *
 * @note The OV PhysX backend reads `ovstage` at ordinal 1. Populate that ordinal when using this backend.
