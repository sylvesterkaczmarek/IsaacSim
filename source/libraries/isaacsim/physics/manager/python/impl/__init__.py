"""Provide the backend-neutral physics simulation manager.

Nanobind bindings provide simulation lifecycle, stepping, scene queries,
interaction, benchmarking, and tensor-view creation. Shared data types and the
engine registration API live in ``isaacsim.physics.registration``.
"""

from isaacsim.physics.manager.bindings._bindings import *  # noqa: F401,F403

# Re-export the registration API and shared vocabulary into this namespace, but
# not into `__all__`, so `isaacsim.physics.manager.impl.<name>` remains
# import-compatible. Their canonical public home is
# `isaacsim.physics.registration`; the public `isaacsim.physics.manager` facade
# exposes only application-facing operations.
