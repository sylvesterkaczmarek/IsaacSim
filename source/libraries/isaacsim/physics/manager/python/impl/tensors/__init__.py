"""Provide the string-keyed Warp data plane for the physics manager.

Engines register explicit single-buffer callbacks with ``_register_impl`` and
multi-buffer callbacks with ``_register_multi_impl``. Consumers discover named
operations and call ``get_data``, ``set_data``, ``get_data_multi``, or
``set_data_multi``. Newton operation names use their plural contract spelling,
including ``dof-positions`` and ``dof-stiffnesses``.

The native implementation is exposed through the manager and registration
nanobind modules.

Warp-only data plane
--------------------

The public contract is Warp-only. Python-registered callbacks are mirrored and
invoked directly with Warp values so callback-owned storage and caller-provided
output-buffer identity are preserved. Native dispatch retains the backing owner
of each returned array and remains the fallback for C++-registered backends.

Index contract
--------------

The data path never synchronizes the device or reads back to the host. That
splits validation of an ``indices`` selection in two:

* **Metadata** -- data type, rank, contiguity, device -- is a host-side property
  of the array, so it costs nothing and is rejected loudly. Indices must be a
  contiguous one-dimensional ``int32`` Warp array on the operation's device.
* **Values** -- whether an index is in range, or repeated -- live in device
  memory. Establishing either would require reading them back, so neither is
  checked and neither raises.

Out-of-range indices are therefore *dropped*, uniformly across CPU and GPU, both
engines, and both the Python and C++ layers:

===========================  ====================================================
operation                    result for an out-of-range index
===========================  ====================================================
``get_data``                 that output row carries the dropped-row marker
``set_data``                 that entity is not written; engine state unchanged
``get_data_multi``           that entity contributes zero records
===========================  ====================================================

The dropped-row marker is the all-bits-set pattern for the buffer's data type:
``NaN`` for floating point, ``-1`` for signed integers, and the maximum for
unsigned. ``bool`` is the documented exception -- every byte is either zero or
truthy, so a dropped row comes back as ``255``, a non-canonical true that a
caller cannot tell from a real one.

Repeated indices are well defined on a read -- the source row is copied to each
output row. On a write they are **undefined**: every write is attempted and the
surviving value depends on device scheduling.

    ``view_kind`` is the simulation-view factory name, such as
    ``create_rigid_contact_view``, and selects view-specific metadata behavior
    even when a no-match view registers no operations.

    Dynamic instance methods invoke mirrored Python callbacks directly with
    Warp values. When no Python callback is mirrored, they call the native
    methods, whose returned arrays retain their backing storage owner.

    Single-buffer results are returned as ``wp.array``. Multi-buffer results
    retain their list structure and each element is returned as ``wp.array``.
    Each native ``get_data`` call resolves the owning simulation view's device
    ordinal. This supports engines that select their device during stepping,
    even when the entity view was created earlier. Eligible native GPU reads
    receive device output buffers so returned arrays reside on the simulation
    device.

    Args:
        view: Entity view to augment, or ``None`` when the native factory
            returned no view.
        sim_view: Simulation view that owns ``view``. Its device is resolved
