"""Exercise signed-distance-field shape queries against analytic box results.

The scenario queries a grid of mesh cubes in each shape's local frame. The
returned ``[N, maxQ, 4]`` tensor
(``grad.x, grad.y, grad.z, distance`` per point) is checked against the
analytic box SDF.

SDF evaluation is GPU-only in ovphysx (``ovphysx_evaluate_sdf`` requires the
query and the output on the GPU). So the GPU lane runs the real evaluation and
the caller-``out`` guards; the CPU lane asserts the view is unsupported
(``count == 0``) — ovphysx refuses to create a CPU SDF view.
