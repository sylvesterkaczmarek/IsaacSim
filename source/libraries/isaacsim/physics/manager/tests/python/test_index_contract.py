"""Pin the dropped-row marker for every data type the tensor API can return.

An out-of-range index is dropped rather than rejected, because rejecting it would
require reading the index values back from the device. The row it would have filled
carries a marker instead of zero, since zero is a legitimate reading for most
bindings and would be indistinguishable from real data.

The live gather paths only exercise the float bindings, so the integer and boolean
branches of the marker are pinned here against the derivation itself.
