========================
isaacsim_physics_engines
========================

``isaacsim-physics-engines`` supplies engine implementations for the
backend-neutral registration and manager APIs:

* ``isaacsim.physics_engines.ovphysx`` uses the OvPhysX runtime.
* ``isaacsim.physics_engines.ovnewton`` uses Newton and Warp.
* ``isaacsim.physics_engines.ovstage`` prepares OVStage's private runtime without modifying ``pxr``.

Activate or register an engine before selecting it through
``isaacsim.physics.manager``.
