"""Provide the Newton physics simulator backend.

Use :func:`register` to publish Newton simulation callbacks through
``isaacsim.physics.registration``. Applications can then select and drive the
registered simulation through the physics manager. Registration does not
require the Kit application lifecycle, and Newton, Warp, and USD are loaded
only when their functionality is needed.

The registration supplies simulation lifecycle, stepping, subscription, time,
and capability callbacks. Scene-query, interaction, and benchmark callbacks
remain unavailable.
