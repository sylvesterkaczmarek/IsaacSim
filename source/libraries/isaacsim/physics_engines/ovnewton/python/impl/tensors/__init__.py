"""Provide the Python and Warp Newton tensor backend.

Importing this module registers Newton view factories with the process-wide
``isaacsim.physics.manager.impl.tensors`` registry. Articulation views expose
dense degree-of-freedom state and configuration, root and link state, inertial
properties, dynamics matrices, force application, and structural metadata.
Degree-of-freedom operations are registered only when their index maps are
rectangular; affected operations remain absent for variable-width selections.

Rigid-body views expose pose, velocity, inertial properties, and force
application. Rigid-contact views expose raw contact records, aggregate sensor
forces, sensor-by-filter forces, and sensor metadata. Operations without a
faithful Newton implementation are marked unsupported, and unsupported entity
families produce empty views without registered operations.

The adapters read the attached ``pxr.Usd.Stage`` and Newton model through
``NewtonStage`` and use Warp for tensor dispatch.
