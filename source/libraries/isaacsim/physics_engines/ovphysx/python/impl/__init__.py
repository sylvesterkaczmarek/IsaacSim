"""Provide the OvPhysX simulation backend.

The backend wraps the OvPhysX SDK behind the physics manager simulation and
tensor APIs. This facade exposes process-level activation, shutdown, and
readback configuration. Activation loads and registers the native backend,
then points the OVStage Python data plane at that same private runtime.
