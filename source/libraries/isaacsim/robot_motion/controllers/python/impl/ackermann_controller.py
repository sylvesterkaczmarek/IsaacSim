class AckermannController(BaseController):
    """Single-robot Ackermann steering controller.

    Converts a control-point linear-velocity setpoint into:

    - Steerable-wheel angular velocities and steering-angle position targets.
    - Non-steerable-wheel angular velocities (if any).

    The setpoint must be a real velocity vector at the control point.  For a vehicle
    travelling at total speed ``v`` with body turning angle ``θ``, the site's
    ``linear_velocity`` should be ``[v·cos θ, v·sin θ, 0]`` in the body frame.

    The controller recovers speed and angle by projection onto the body axes:

    - ``v_x           = dot(linear_velocity, forward_direction)``
    - ``v_y           = dot(linear_velocity, lateral_direction)``
    - ``linear_speed  = sign(v_x) · ‖[v_x, v_y]‖``
    - ``turning_angle = atan2(v_y, v_x)``   (forward, ``v_x > 0``)
    - ``turning_angle = atan2(-v_y, -v_x)`` (reversing, ``v_x ≤ 0``)

    where ``lateral_direction = normalize(cross(rotation_direction, forward_direction))``.

    Negating both components for reversing keeps ``turning_angle`` in ``(-π/2, π/2)``.
    Positive turning angle steers to the left (counterclockwise from above with the
    default ``rotation_direction = [0, 0, 1]``).

    Both direction vectors are normalized at construction time and must be at least
    89.9 degrees apart.

    Args:
        robot_joint_space: Ordered list of all joint names in the robot.

            automatically as ``+non_steerable_track_width / 2``.
        right_non_steerable_wheel_joint: Name of the right non-steerable wheel joint in
            ``robot_joint_space`` (velocity target). Must be provided together with
            ``left_non_steerable_wheel_joint``. Its lateral offset is derived
            automatically as ``-non_steerable_track_width / 2``.
        non_steerable_wheel_radius: Radius of the non-steerable wheels [m]. When
            ``None``, falls back to ``steerable_wheel_radius``.

            [m]. When ``None``, falls back to ``track_width``.

            limit is applied.
        max_turning_angle: Steering angle clamp [rad]. Must be in ``(0, π/2]``.
        steerable_wheels_at_rear: Pass ``True`` for rear-wheel-steering vehicles
            (e.g. forklifts).
        direct_command: Pass ``True`` to ignore ``setpoint_state`` in
            :meth:`forward` and read speed and angle directly from kwargs instead.
        linear_speed_kwarg: Name of the :meth:`forward` kwarg that carries the
            signed total speed [m/s] in direct mode.
        turning_angle_kwarg: Name of the :meth:`forward` kwarg that carries the
            body turning angle [rad] in direct mode.
        control_point_name: Name of the site in ``setpoint_state.sites`` from which
            ``linear_velocity`` is read. Unused when ``direct_command=True``.
        forward_direction: Robot forward axis in the body frame. Normalized at
            construction.
        rotation_direction: Yaw axis in the body frame. Normalized at construction.
            Must be at least 89.9° from ``forward_direction``. Used to derive
            ``lateral_direction`` as
            ``normalize(cross(rotation_direction, forward_direction))``.
        device: Warp device for internal buffers. Defaults to ``wp.get_device()``.
