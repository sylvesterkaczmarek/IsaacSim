"""Kit-free smoke test for the ``isaacsim.robot_motion.experimental.motion_generation`` library.

This test intentionally imports **only** the public library and the standard library. It runs outside of Omniverse Kit
(no ``omni.kit.app``, no ``SimulationApp``) to prove that the relocated motion generation package is importable in a
pure Kit-free environment, that its frozen public API is unchanged, and that no ``carb`` / ``omni.*`` module is pulled in
as a side effect of importing it. The heavier behavioural tests continue to run under the carrier extension in Kit.
