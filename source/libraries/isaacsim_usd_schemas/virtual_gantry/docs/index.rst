==============================
isaacsim_virtual_gantry_schema
==============================

``isaacsim_virtual_gantry_schema`` provides the Universal Scene Description
(USD) schema for a virtual gantry. The ``IsaacVirtualGantry`` typed prim uses
its world transform as the anchor for a one-sided spring-damper rope attached
to an articulation link.

Use this distribution to author and inspect virtual-gantry attributes and
relationships without adding gantry-specific concepts to the general robot
schema. The package supplies the schema resources and Python accessors for the
supported OpenUSD versions.
