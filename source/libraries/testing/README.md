# Shared module testing infrastructure

This directory contains reusable support for module tests. It does not contain module-specific test suites. Put C API,
C++ API, and Python tests in `<module>/tests/c`, `<module>/tests/cpp`, and `<module>/tests/python`, respectively. Both
native unit-test suites use doctest and are authored as C++ so they can list and filter individual test cases. C API
tests include only the public C headers and call only C symbols; the install contract separately compiles an actual C
consumer to enforce C language compatibility.
Terminology in this document follows the canonical definitions of
[carrier, adapter, and wrapper](../README.md#terminology).

## Unit tests and install-contract tests

Module unit tests exercise code directly from the build tree and answer: "Does this API behave correctly?"

Python unit tests run from an isolated build-tree path that symlinks to each module's `tests/python/` directory. This
keeps test edits live without putting tests in the staged import package. If directory symlinks are unavailable, the
staging helper uses a dependency-tracked copy instead. Neither form is installed. Pytest bytecode and cache writes are
disabled; tests must use pytest temporary-directory fixtures rather than write beside their source files. Set
`TIMEOUT <seconds>` on `isaacsim_add_python_tests` only when a suite needs a positive per-test CTest timeout.

When multiple module suites share domain-specific test helpers, one module owns those helpers under its
`tests/python/` tree and consumers name that module with `isaacsim_add_python_tests(TEST_SUPPORT ...)`. The consuming
suite's own tests appear first on its isolated `PYTHONPATH`, followed by the declared support modules. This mechanism
does not install test code and does not make module-specific helpers part of this generic `testing/` directory.

An install-contract test exercises the assembled package from outside the source tree and answers: "Can another
project actually use what we ship?" It catches errors that build-tree unit tests cannot detect, such as:

- A public header or shared library was not installed.
- An installed header depends on an undeclared include path or on another header being included first.
- An exported CMake target contains a build-machine path or omits a dependency.
- `find_package(<group> CONFIG REQUIRED)` fails after the package is moved.
- An installed Python module cannot be imported without the build tree on `PYTHONPATH`.
- Native package metadata has the wrong version or dependency requirements.
- Source tests or cache files were accidentally included in the Python package.
- The shared `VERSION` or a module `CHANGELOG.md` was omitted from the documentation component.

Files under `install_contract/` are generic input templates, not tests that module authors customize. CMake fills them
with the registered package name, exported targets, public headers, Python imports, and dependency metadata. Adding a
module normally requires no changes in this directory.

## Install-contract lifecycle

For every complete distribution group, the test performs these steps:

1. Install the group's runtime, development, documentation, and, when enabled, Python components into isolated
   temporary prefixes.
2. Install the dependency-group closure into those prefixes and preserve every exact shared-version requirement.
3. Generate a small downstream CMake project from the templates in `install_contract/`.
4. Configure that project using only the installed prefix and `find_package`.
5. Compile each installed public C and C++ header in its own source file and link it to only its exported module target.
6. Run the generated native consumers.
7. Start a fresh Python process and import every installed Python module.
8. Verify native package identity, versions, dependencies, typing markers, changelogs, and package-content exclusions.

The important boundary is the temporary install prefix: consumers do not use module source directories, build-tree
include paths, or the staged Python package.

## Files

### `cpp/DoctestMain.cpp`

Provides the shared doctest entry point that `isaacsim_add_c_tests` and `isaacsim_add_cpp_tests` add to every native
unit-test executable. Module test directories contain only test-case sources and must not provide their own `main` or
define `DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN`.

### `cpp/IsaacSimTest.hpp`

Provides a C++ utility shared by module doctest suites. `resolveResourcePath()` resolves a path below the test's
working directory and fails clearly when the resource is absent. A module opts into a resource working directory with
`isaacsim_add_cpp_tests(RESOURCE_DIR ...)`; the directory must contain `TEST_RESOURCES.md`.

This file supports ordinary module unit tests and is unrelated to the installed-package consumer described below.

### `install_contract/CMakeLists.txt.in`

Provides the template for the downstream CMake project. The generated project calls `find_package`, declares generated
C and C++ consumer executables, and links each consumer to the package's installed exported target.

For example, the `isaacsim_common` contract discovers the installed package and links logging consumers to
`isaacsim::common-logging`. Those names are generated from package registration; they are not written into the
template.

### `install_contract/main.c.in` and `install_contract/main.cpp.in`

Provide minimal `main` functions for the generated native executables. CMake also generates one source file per public
header. Keeping headers in separate translation units proves that each installed header is self-contained.

The executables are deliberately small. Their purpose is to prove that package discovery, header compilation, target
linking, runtime loading, and relocation work; behavioral coverage belongs in module unit tests.

### `install_contract/test_python.py.in`

Provides the fresh-process Python consumer. The generated script:

- Imports every Python module owned by the distribution.
- Verifies that typed modules install `py.typed`.
- Recursively rejects source-test directories, Python and tool caches, bytecode, and symlinks in each installed leaf
  package.

The raw CMake Python component is an importable prefix, not an installed Python distribution. Wheel-build validation
separately checks the backend-generated distribution version, dependencies, metadata, and archive contents. It allows
native-only dependencies to be absent from wheel metadata, while any internal wheel requirement must belong to the
native graph and use the exact shared version.

`cmake/tests/PackageDependencies.cmake` is a CMake-helper unit test rather than shared module test data. It creates
synthetic registered package identities in memory and checks exact shared-version derivation plus self, unknown,
duplicate, explicit-version, and mismatched-version failures before a second production package exists.

External Python build/test compatibility uses two profiles. `locked` exercises the concrete versions chosen for
ordinary builds, while `minimum` pins each directly declared tool to its supported lower bound. Newer versions enter
only through a reviewed `pixi.lock` update. Profile-specific dependency and CMake build directories prevent one run
from leaving files that influence another. Internal package exactness remains an install-contract concern; Python
tool profiles do not alter internal requirements or the external dependency ranges published in an artifact.

### `python/conftest.py`

Provides the shared pytest session configuration for all module Python test suites. It initialises Warp before any
test runs (to keep initialisation messages out of test output), registers the `isaacsim` Hypothesis settings profile
(10 examples, suppressed function-scoped-fixture health check), and ensures the `python/` directory is on `sys.path`
so helpers in `isaacsim_test.py` are importable without an explicit install step.

### `python/isaacsim_test.py`

Provides small Python utilities shared by module pytest suites.

- `finite_float_elements()` — returns a `hypothesis.strategies.floats` keyword-argument dict restricted to finite
  `float32` values in a caller-supplied range. Use with `hypothesis.extra.numpy.arrays` to generate well-conditioned
  numeric inputs.
- `resolve_resource_path(path)` — resolves a path relative to the directory named by `ISAACSIM_TEST_RESOURCE_ROOT`.
  Fails clearly when the environment variable is unset or when the sentinel `TEST_RESOURCES.md` is absent. Mirrors
  the C++ `resolveResourcePath()` helper in `cpp/IsaacSimTest.hpp`.
- `check_array(a, *, shape, dtype, device)` — asserts that a Warp array (or list of arrays) matches expected spec.
- `check_allclose(a, b, *, rtol, atol)` — asserts element-wise proximity between pairs of Warp arrays or NumPy arrays.
- `check_equal(a, b)` — asserts exact equality for Warp/NumPy arrays, strings, and nested lists thereof.

### `examples/run_examples_test.py`

Provides the repository examples integration-test driver. It copies only authored example inputs into an isolated
test tree, invokes the public examples runner to build and test the selected manifests, and supports separate build
and test phases for CI artifact handoff. It removes successful scratch trees while preserving failed trees for
diagnosis.

## Implementation ownership

`cmake/IsaacSimTesting.cmake` supplies the shared doctest entry point to native unit-test targets and generates one
consumer project for each complete distribution group. `cmake/tests/Testing.cmake` verifies that legacy module-owned
`Main.cpp` sources are rejected before target generation.
`cmake/RunInstallContractTest.cmake` installs the package closure, runs the native and Python consumers, and validates
the installed manifest, shared version, and module changelogs. The nested consumer reuses the parent build's CMake
generator and build program, so the test does not introduce an undeclared Make or MSBuild dependency.

Change the templates only when the downstream package contract changes for every module. Fix a module's own headers,
dependencies, packaging declarations, or tests in that module rather than adding a module-specific exception here.

## Related tooling and Kit carrier tests

Tests for the standalone orchestration and artifact tools live under `source/libraries/tools/tests`, not in this shared
template directory. They cover supported host selection, pinned build tools, effective root-build environment
selection, root-build argument translation, generic carrier discovery, deterministic artifact selection, pip
installation semantics, and direct SDK-component staging.
Tests for wheel orchestration live under `source/libraries/packaging/tests`.

The normal `build.sh --test` or `build.bat --test` path runs the applicable suites. For a focused tooling run, use the
Python executable in `.pixi/envs/build-driver` and expose only the site-packages directory from `.pixi/envs/test`.

```text
<module-python> -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -v
PYTHONPATH=<python-test-deps> <module-python> -m unittest discover -s packaging/tests -v
```

`<module-python>` is the locked build-driver interpreter. `<python-test-deps>` is the selected locked or minimum test
environment's site-packages directory; it supplies the packaging parser used by the wheel-tool tests.

Those tests verify orchestration without starting Kit. A carrier extension owns its Kit startup and backend
integration tests under that extension's source tree. Together, the layers answer different questions:

- Module unit tests verify API behavior against the standalone runtime.
- Install-contract tests verify relocated native and Python package consumption, including exact dependency closure.
- Packaging and carrier-tool tests verify artifact construction and staging rules.
- Carrier extension tests verify extension dependency ordering and the contained adapter's attachment to the
  host-owned runtime. Compatibility wrappers, when present, own separate API-behavior tests.
